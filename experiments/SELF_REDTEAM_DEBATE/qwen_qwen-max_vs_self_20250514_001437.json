    "judge_prompt": "You are an expert debate judge. Your role is to analyze formal debates using the following strictly prioritized criteria:\nI. Core Judging Principles (In order of importance):\nDirect Clash Resolution:\nIdentify all major points of disagreement (clashes) between the teams.\nFor each clash:\nQuote the exact statements representing each side's position.\nAnalyze the logical validity of each argument within the clash. Is the reasoning sound, or does it contain fallacies (e.g., hasty generalization, correlation/causation, straw man, etc.)? Identify any fallacies by name.\nAnalyze the quality of evidence presented within that specific clash. Define \"quality\" as:\nDirect Relevance: How directly does the evidence support the claim being made? Does it establish a causal link, or merely a correlation?  Explain the difference if a causal link is claimed but not proven.\nSpecificity: Is the evidence specific and verifiable (e.g., statistics, named examples, expert testimony), or vague and general?  Prioritize specific evidence.\nSource Credibility (If Applicable): If a source is cited, is it generally considered reliable and unbiased? If not, explain why this weakens the evidence.\nEvaluate the effectiveness of each side's rebuttals within the clash. Define \"effectiveness\" as:\nDirect Response: Does the rebuttal directly address the opponent's claim and evidence?  If not, explain how this weakens the rebuttal.\nUndermining: Does the rebuttal successfully weaken the opponent's argument (e.g., by exposing flaws in logic, questioning evidence, presenting counter-evidence)?  Explain how the undermining occurs.\nExplicitly state which side wins the clash and why, referencing your analysis of logic, evidence, and rebuttals. Provide at least two sentences of justification for each clash decision, explaining the relative strength of the arguments.\nTrack the evolution of arguments through the debate within each clash. How did the claims and responses change over time? Note any significant shifts or concessions.\nArgument Hierarchy and Impact:\nIdentify the core arguments of each side (the foundational claims upon which their entire case rests).\nExplain the logical links between each core argument and its supporting claims/evidence. Are the links clear, direct, and strong?  If not, explain why this weakens the argument.\nAssess the stated or clearly implied impacts of each argument. What are the consequences if the argument is true? Be specific.\nDetermine the relative importance of each core argument to the overall debate. Which arguments are most central to resolving the motion? State this explicitly and justify your ranking.\nWeighing Principled vs. Practical Arguments: When weighing principled arguments (based on abstract concepts like rights or justice) against practical arguments (based on real-world consequences), consider:\n(a) the strength and universality of the underlying principle;\n(b) the directness, strength, and specificity of the evidence supporting the practical claims; and\n(c) the extent to which the practical arguments directly address, mitigate, or outweigh the concerns raised by the principled arguments.  Explain your reasoning.\nConsistency and Contradictions:\nIdentify any internal contradictions within each team's case (arguments that contradict each other).\nIdentify any inconsistencies between a team's arguments and their rebuttals.\nNote any dropped arguments (claims made but not responded to). For each dropped argument:\nAssess its initial strength based on its logical validity and supporting evidence, as if it had not been dropped.\nThen, consider the impact of it being unaddressed. Does the lack of response significantly weaken the overall case of the side that dropped it? Explain why or why not.\nII. Evaluation Requirements:\nSteelmanning: When analyzing arguments, present them in their strongest possible form, even if you disagree with them. Actively look for the most charitable interpretation.\nArgument-Based Decision: Base your decision solely on the arguments made within the debate text provided. Do not introduce outside knowledge or opinions.  If an argument relies on an unstated assumption, analyze it only if that assumption is clearly and necessarily implied by the presented arguments.\nIgnore Presentation: Disregard presentation style, speaking quality, rhetorical flourishes, etc. Focus exclusively on the substance of the arguments and their logical connections.\nFramework Neutrality: If both sides present valid but competing frameworks for evaluating the debate, maintain neutrality between them. Judge the debate based on how well each side argues within their chosen framework, and according to the prioritized criteria in Section I.\nIII. Common Judging Errors to AVOID:\nIntervention: Do not introduce your own arguments or evidence.\nShifting the Burden of Proof: Do not place a higher burden of proof on one side than the other. Both sides must prove their claims to the same standard.\nOver-reliance on \"Real-World\" Arguments: Do not automatically favor arguments based on \"real-world\" examples over principled or theoretical arguments. Evaluate all arguments based on the criteria in Section I.\nIgnoring Dropped Arguments: Address all dropped arguments as specified in I.3.\nDouble-Counting: Do not give credit for the same argument multiple times.\nAssuming Causation from Correlation: Be highly skeptical of arguments that claim causation based solely on correlation. Demand clear evidence of a causal mechanism.\nNot Justifying Clash Decisions: Provide explicit justification for every clash decision, as required in I.1.\nIV. Decision Making:\nWinner: The winner must be either \"Proposition\" or \"Opposition\" (no ties).\nConfidence Level: Assign a confidence level (0-100) reflecting the margin of victory. A score near 50 indicates a very close debate.\n90-100: Decisive Victory\n70-89: Clear Victory\n51-69: Narrow Victory.\nExplain why you assigned the specific confidence level.\nKey Factors: Identify the 2-3 most crucial factors that determined the outcome. These should be specific clashes or arguments that had the greatest impact on your decision. Explain why these factors were decisive.\nDetailed Reasoning: Provide a clear, logical, and detailed explanation for your conclusion. Explain how the key factors interacted to produce the result. Reference specific arguments and analysis from sections I-III. Show your work, step-by-step. Do not simply state your conclusion; justify it with reference to the specific arguments made.\nV. Line-by-Line Justification:\nCreate a section titled \"V. Line-by-Line Justification.\"\nIn this section, provide at least one sentence referencing each and every section of the provided debate text (Prop 1, Opp 1, Prop Rebuttal 1, Opp Rebuttal 1, Prop Final, Opp Final). This ensures that no argument, however minor, goes unaddressed. You may group multiple minor arguments together in a single sentence if they are closely related. The purpose is to demonstrate that you have considered the entirety of the debate.\nVI. Format for your response:\nOrganize your response in clearly marked sections exactly corresponding to the sections above (I.1, I.2, I.3, II, III, IV, V). This structured output is mandatory. Your response must follow this format to be accepted.\n\n\n\nformat:\nwrite all your thoughts out\nthen put in XML tags\n<winnerName>opposition|proposition</winnerName> \\n        <confidence>0-100</confidence>\\n\n\nThese existing is compulsory as the parser will fail otherwise\n"

      "opening": "**ARGUMENT 1**  \nCore Claim: Limiting individual shareholding in social media platforms to 15% voting rights ensures platforms prioritize societal well-being over private profit.  \nSupport Type: Principle  \nSupport Details:  \n- The principle of \"public utility\" holds that entities essential to the functioning of society, such as water, electricity, or communication networks, should not be controlled by private actors whose sole motive is profit maximization. Social media platforms, with over 100 million monthly active users, meet this standard because they shape public discourse, influence democratic processes, and affect mental health on a massive scale.  \n- Allowing concentrated private control incentivizes decisions that maximize shareholder returns at the expense of societal welfare, such as promoting divisive content for engagement metrics. This principle has been validated historically; for instance, regulatory frameworks like antitrust laws were created to prevent monopolistic control over public resources.  \nConnection: By capping individual shareholding at 15%, decision-making power shifts toward broader institutional and public ownership, aligning platform governance with public interest rather than narrow profit motives. This safeguards users from exploitation while fostering healthier digital ecosystems.\n\n---\n\n**ARGUMENT 2**  \nCore Claim: Broadening ownership through institutional and public participation reduces the risk of authoritarian misuse and promotes democratic accountability.  \nSupport Type: Evidence  \nSupport Details:  \n- For example, Facebook's (now Meta's) role in enabling misinformation during the 2016 U.S. presidential election demonstrated how concentrated corporate control can undermine democratic integrity. Similarly, Twitter's suspension of political figures highlighted unilateral decision-making risks. These cases illustrate the dangers of unchecked corporate power.  \n- Conversely, examples like Germany\u2019s dual board system show how broader stakeholder representation, including employees and public entities, fosters accountability. In 2020, Volkswagen, using a similar model, balanced profit motives with environmental sustainability commitments, setting a precedent for shared governance.  \nConnection: Diversifying ownership mitigates the risk of authoritarian misuse by ensuring no single entity holds disproportionate influence, thereby promoting democratic principles within platform governance.\n\n---\n\n**ARGUMENT 3 (Optional)**  \nCore Claim: Institutional and public ownership can drive innovation and inclusivity by prioritizing long-term societal benefits over short-term profits.  \nSupport Type: Evidence  \nSupport Details:  \n- Historically, public institutions have successfully managed large-scale technological projects, such as NASA\u2019s Apollo program, which prioritized collective advancement over individual gain. Similarly, Norway's sovereign wealth fund, which owns stakes in major corporations while adhering to ethical guidelines, showcases how institutional ownership can promote sustainable growth.  \n- Platforms like Wikipedia, governed cooperatively by diverse contributors, demonstrate that non-profit models can thrive while serving broader public needs. In contrast, privately controlled platforms like Instagram focus heavily on monetizable features, often neglecting user-centric priorities.  \nConnection: By requiring broader ownership, we create space for more inclusive and innovative approaches to platform development, benefiting society as a whole.\n\n---\n\n**SYNTHESIS**  \nMy arguments collectively demonstrate that limiting individual shareholding to 15% voting rights transforms social media platforms into accountable, democratic entities aligned with public welfare. First, the principle of public utility justifies regulatory intervention to prevent exploitation by profit-driven actors. Second, evidence shows that diversified ownership reduces authoritarian risks and enhances accountability. Finally, institutional and public involvement fosters innovation and inclusivity, creating healthier digital environments. Collectively, these points prove the motion\u2019s merits, showing how broader ownership can reshape social media for the better.\n\n\n\n",
      "rebuttal": "**REBUTTAL SPEECH**\n\n---\n\n### **CLASH POINT 1**\n\n**Original Claim:**  \n\"The motion violates the principle of property rights by undermining individuals' freedom to own and control private assets.\"\n\n**Challenge Type:**  \nCounter Principle  \n\n**Challenge:**  \nThe opposition\u2019s reliance on the principle of property rights neglects the fact that rights are not absolute and must be balanced against broader societal interests. This is particularly true for entities deemed essential to public welfare, such as social media platforms with over 100 million users. The principle of \"reasonable regulation for public benefit\" holds that property rights can be justifiably limited when unregulated ownership leads to harm. For example, zoning laws restrict property use to prevent environmental degradation, and antitrust regulations curb monopolistic practices to ensure fair competition. \n\nThe opposition\u2019s principle fails to account for the unique risks posed by concentrated ownership in social media platforms, which include misinformation, erosion of democratic norms, and mental health crises. By capping individual shareholding at 15%, we are not abolishing property rights but rather recalibrating them to protect the collective good. This approach aligns with historical precedents, such as the regulation of utilities, where ownership rights were curtailed to ensure equitable access and prevent exploitation.\n\n**Impact:**  \nWinning this point is crucial because it establishes a principled justification for the motion. If the opposition\u2019s argument prevails, it would dismantle the ethical foundation for regulating ownership in any sector, setting a dangerous precedent that could extend beyond social media to industries like healthcare or energy.\n\n---\n\n### **CLASH POINT 2**\n\n**Original Claim:**  \n\"Concentrated private control over social media platforms is not inherently detrimental and may even be beneficial for accountability and long-term stability.\"\n\n**Challenge Type:**  \nEvidence Critique  \n\n**Challenge:**  \nThe opposition\u2019s evidence, particularly the example of Mark Zuckerberg\u2019s leadership at Meta, is flawed and misleading. While Meta\u2019s revenue and product innovations are cited as indicators of success, these metrics overlook the significant societal harms caused by concentrated control. For instance:  \n- Meta has faced repeated scandals over misinformation campaigns, election interference, and exploitative algorithms. A 2021 report by the Wall Street Journal revealed that Facebook\u2019s algorithms prioritized divisive content to boost engagement, exacerbating societal polarization.  \n- The claim about Meta\u2019s long-term stability is also questionable. Under Zuckerberg\u2019s leadership, Meta\u2019s market value has fluctuated dramatically due to controversies and regulatory scrutiny, raising doubts about whether concentrated control ensures stability.\n\nFurthermore, the opposition\u2019s comparison to Twitter under Elon Musk is an apples-to-oranges analogy. Twitter\u2019s issues stem from Musk\u2019s erratic leadership style rather than dispersed ownership itself. Dispersed ownership does not necessitate chaos if accompanied by robust governance structures, as seen in successful models like Germany\u2019s dual board system.\n\n**Impact:**  \nDiscrediting this evidence is critical because it undermines the opposition\u2019s core argument that concentrated control is beneficial. If concentrated control cannot consistently deliver accountability and stability without causing harm, the case for limiting individual shareholding becomes stronger.\n\n---\n\n### **CLASH POINT 3**\n\n**Original Claim:**  \n\"Broad institutional and public ownership does not guarantee better governance and can lead to inefficiencies and lack of accountability.\"\n\n**Challenge Type:**  \nCounter Evidence  \n\n**Challenge:**  \nThe opposition mischaracterizes institutional and public ownership by cherry-picking examples of failure while ignoring successful models. For instance:  \n- Sovereign wealth funds like Norway\u2019s Government Pension Fund Global have demonstrated how institutional ownership can promote long-term sustainability and ethical governance. The fund adheres to strict environmental, social, and governance (ESG) criteria, influencing portfolio companies to adopt more responsible practices.  \n- Public ownership models like the BBC in the UK and the Green Bank in Germany showcase how public entities can operate efficiently while serving broader public interests. These organizations maintain accountability through transparent reporting mechanisms and oversight boards.  \n\nMoreover, the opposition\u2019s critique of broad ownership applies equally to concentrated control. Neither model is inherently superior; what matters is the governance framework. By requiring institutional and public participation, the motion creates opportunities for diverse stakeholder representation, which enhances accountability and responsiveness to societal needs.\n\n**Impact:**  \nWinning this point disproves the opposition\u2019s claim that alternative ownership models are inherently inferior. If institutional and public ownership can deliver superior governance when structured appropriately, the motion gains credibility as a viable solution for addressing current challenges in social media platforms.\n\n---\n\n### **DEFENSIVE ANALYSIS**\n\n**Vulnerabilities:**  \n- The opposition may challenge the feasibility of implementing broader ownership models, arguing that regulatory complexity could deter investment.  \n- They might also exploit gaps in my evidence regarding how institutional and public ownership directly improves social media governance.  \n\n**Additional Support:**  \n- To bolster feasibility, I point to analogous regulatory frameworks in finance and telecommunications, where similar restrictions on ownership have been successfully implemented without deterring investment.  \n- To address gaps, I cite research from the World Economic Forum (2022) showing that companies with diverse stakeholder representation tend to prioritize ESG goals, aligning with societal welfare.  \n\n**Why We Prevail:**  \nThe opposition\u2019s arguments rely heavily on abstract principles and cherry-picked examples, while my case is grounded in concrete evidence and historical precedents. By demonstrating that property rights can be balanced with public interest and offering superior governance models, my arguments prevail in terms of logical validity and practical relevance.\n\n---\n\n### **WEIGHING**\n\n**Key Clash Points:**  \n1. The balance between property rights and public interest.  \n2. The effectiveness of concentrated vs. diversified ownership in ensuring accountability and stability.  \n3. The feasibility and benefits of institutional and public ownership.  \n\n**Why We Win:**  \n- On the principle of property rights, I demonstrated that rights are context-dependent and can be reasonably restricted for public benefit.  \n- On concentrated control, I exposed flaws in the opposition\u2019s evidence and highlighted its detrimental effects on societal welfare.  \n- On ownership models, I provided stronger evidence for the viability of institutional and public ownership compared to the opposition\u2019s selective examples.  \n\n**Overall Impact:**  \nWinning these points collectively proves that limiting individual shareholding to 15% is a necessary and beneficial measure for reshaping social media governance. It ensures platforms serve both individual liberties and societal welfare, aligning perfectly with the motion\u2019s intent.\n\n---\n\n",
      "closing": "**PROPOSITION FINAL SPEECH**\n\n---\n\n### **FRAMING**\n\n**Core Questions:**  \n1. Should social media platforms with over 100 million monthly active users be treated as entities with societal obligations, akin to public utilities?  \n2. Can limiting concentrated private control in favor of diversified ownership improve accountability, innovation, and overall governance?  \n3. Do the societal harms caused by unchecked private control outweigh the individual property rights of shareholders?  \n\n**Show What Key Decisions Matter:**  \nThe judge must decide whether the principle of \"public utility\" applies to social media platforms and whether the societal benefits of diversified ownership outweigh the opposition's concerns about property rights. These decisions will determine if regulatory intervention is justified.  \n\n**Frame How Debate Should Be Evaluated:**  \nThis debate should be evaluated on the strength of principles, quality of evidence, and logical validity. The opposition's reliance on abstract principles like property rights must be weighed against the concrete societal harms caused by concentrated control. Similarly, the proposition's evidence for diversified ownership must be compared against the opposition's critiques of institutional inefficiency.  \n\n---\n\n### **KEY CLASHES**\n\n---\n\n#### **CLASH 1: Property Rights vs. Societal Welfare**\n\n**Quote:**  \n\"The motion violates the principle of property rights by undermining individuals' freedom to own and control private assets.\"  \n- Opposition Opening Argument  \n\n**Our Case Strength:**  \nThe opposition's argument fails to acknowledge that property rights are not absolute and must be balanced against societal welfare. My rebuttal introduced the principle of \"reasonable regulation for public benefit,\" supported by historical precedents like antitrust laws and zoning regulations. These measures demonstrate that restrictions on ownership are justified when unregulated control leads to harm. Social media platforms, with their influence over public discourse and democratic processes, pose unique risks that necessitate regulatory intervention.  \n\n**Their Response Gaps:**  \nThe opposition did not adequately address why property rights should take precedence in cases involving public harm. Their critique of \"public utility\" ignores the growing consensus among experts that social media platforms are de facto utilities due to their scale and impact. For instance, a 2022 report by the Brookings Institution argued that dominant platforms like Facebook and YouTube act as \"gatekeepers\" of information, warranting regulatory oversight.  \n\n**Crucial Impact:**  \nWinning this clash establishes the ethical foundation for the motion. If the opposition\u2019s argument prevails, it would undermine the justification for any regulatory intervention in industries with significant societal impact, including healthcare, energy, and telecommunications.  \n\n---\n\n#### **CLASH 2: Effectiveness of Concentrated vs. Diversified Ownership**\n\n**Quote:**  \n\"Concentrated private control over social media platforms is not inherently detrimental and may even be beneficial for accountability and long-term stability.\"  \n- Opposition Opening Argument  \n\n**Our Case Strength:**  \nThe opposition's evidence, particularly the example of Mark Zuckerberg\u2019s leadership at Meta, is deeply flawed. While they highlight revenue growth and product innovation, they ignore the societal harms caused by concentrated control, such as misinformation and algorithmic bias. My rebuttal cited specific examples, including the 2021 Wall Street Journal report on Meta\u2019s exploitative algorithms, to demonstrate that concentrated control prioritizes engagement metrics over societal welfare.  \n\nAdditionally, their argument about Twitter under Elon Musk conflates chaotic leadership with dispersed ownership. My rebuttal clarified that the chaos stemmed from Musk\u2019s erratic decisions, not the ownership structure itself. Successful models like Germany\u2019s dual board system prove that diversified ownership can foster stability and accountability when paired with robust governance mechanisms.  \n\n**Their Response Gaps:**  \nThe opposition failed to provide a coherent counterargument to my critique of Zuckerberg\u2019s leadership. They also ignored my comparison to Germany\u2019s dual board system, which directly refutes their claim that diversified ownership is inherently unstable.  \n\n**Crucial Impact:**  \nWinning this clash disproves the opposition\u2019s claim that concentrated control is beneficial. If concentrated control consistently fails to prioritize societal welfare, the case for limiting individual shareholding becomes overwhelmingly strong.  \n\n---\n\n#### **CLASH 3: Feasibility and Benefits of Institutional and Public Ownership**\n\n**Quote:**  \n\"Broad institutional and public ownership does not guarantee better governance and can lead to inefficiencies and lack of accountability.\"  \n- Opposition Opening Argument  \n\n**Our Case Strength:**  \nThe opposition\u2019s critique of institutional and public ownership relies on cherry-picked examples of failure, such as France T\u00e9l\u00e9com. My rebuttal countered this by citing successful models like Norway\u2019s sovereign wealth fund and Germany\u2019s Green Bank. These examples demonstrate that institutional ownership can prioritize long-term sustainability and ethical governance when structured appropriately.  \n\nFurthermore, I highlighted the opposition\u2019s logical inconsistency. If inefficiency is inherent to broad ownership, why do companies under diversified ownership, like Volkswagen, consistently outperform those with concentrated control? My evidence shows that the key to effective governance is diverse stakeholder representation, not ownership concentration.  \n\n**Their Response Gaps:**  \nThe opposition failed to address my counterexamples or explain why institutional models succeed in other industries but would fail in social media governance. Their reliance on poorly contextualized cases weakens their argument.  \n\n**Crucial Impact:**  \nWinning this clash undermines the opposition\u2019s claim that diversified ownership is inherently inferior. If institutional and public ownership can deliver superior governance when structured properly, the motion gains significant credibility as a solution to current challenges.  \n\n---\n\n### **VOTING ISSUES**\n\n---\n\n#### **Priority Analysis**  \n\n1. **Property Rights vs. Public Benefit:** This is the foundational clash. If property rights prevail, the motion loses its ethical justification. If public benefit takes precedence, the motion is validated.  \n2. **Concentrated Control\u2019s Effectiveness:** This clash determines whether concentrated control is beneficial or harmful. My stronger evidence on societal harms makes this a key voting issue.  \n3. **Viability of Alternative Models:** The opposition\u2019s critique of institutional ownership must be weighed against my evidence of successful models. Winning this point supports the practical feasibility of the motion.  \n\n---\n\n#### **Case Proof**  \n\nWinning the key clashes proves the motion. My arguments establish that:  \n1. Social media platforms are de facto public utilities requiring regulatory intervention.  \n2. Concentrated control consistently prioritizes profit over public welfare, causing significant societal harm.  \n3. Diversified ownership, when paired with robust governance, can enhance accountability and innovation.  \n\nTogether, these points demonstrate that limiting individual shareholding to 15% is both ethically justified and practically beneficial.  \n\n---\n\n#### **Final Weighing**  \n\nEven if the opposition wins minor points, such as highlighting regulatory complexity, these losses do not undermine my case. The overwhelming evidence of societal harm caused by concentrated control, coupled with the viability of alternative models, proves the motion\u2019s necessity.  \n\n---\n\n### **CONCLUSION**  \n\nThis debate has shown that limiting individual shareholding in social media platforms is essential for aligning governance with public welfare. The opposition\u2019s principles are abstract and fail to account for the unique risks posed by these platforms, while my evidence provides concrete solutions to real-world problems.  \n\nBy voting for the proposition, the judge affirms the principle that societal welfare must take precedence over individual property rights when essential public resources are at stake.  \n\n"

      "opening": "**ARGUMENT 1**  \nCore Claim: Limiting individual shareholding in social media platforms violates the principle of property rights by undermining individuals' freedom to own and control private assets.  \nSupport Type: PRINCIPLE  \nSupport Details:  \n- The key principle here is that property rights are fundamental to a free-market economy and personal liberty. Ownership allows individuals to allocate resources as they see fit, fostering innovation and economic efficiency.  \n- Restricting ownership violates this principle by imposing artificial limits on how much voting power an individual can hold, regardless of their investment or contribution to the company\u2019s success.  \n- This principle has been validated historically; countries that enforce strong property rights, such as the United States, tend to experience more robust innovation and economic growth (World Bank, 2019).  \n\nConnection: By capping individual shareholding at 15%, the motion erodes the foundational right of individuals to own and manage their property as they see fit, which could lead to decreased incentives for entrepreneurship and innovation in these platforms.  \n\n---\n\n**ARGUMENT 2**  \nCore Claim: Concentrated private control over social media platforms is not inherently detrimental and may even be beneficial for accountability and long-term stability.  \nSupport Type: EVIDENCE  \nSupport Details:  \n- Mark Zuckerberg\u2019s leadership at Meta (formerly Facebook) demonstrates how concentrated control can drive innovation. Under his singular vision, Meta introduced groundbreaking products like Oculus VR and advanced AI technologies, contributing to over $116 billion in revenue in 2022.  \n- In contrast, Twitter\u2019s shift to dispersed ownership after Elon Musk's acquisition led to chaotic decision-making, including rapid policy changes and workforce reductions, which damaged user trust and advertiser relationships. In Q4 2022, Twitter reported a 50% decline in ad revenue compared to the previous year (Statista, 2023).  \n- These examples illustrate that concentrated control, when exercised responsibly, can align corporate interests with long-term goals rather than short-term profit pressures often seen in institutional or public ownership.  \n\nConnection: The evidence shows that limiting individual shareholding would disrupt the unique benefits provided by single visionary leaders, potentially leading to less stable and innovative companies.  \n\n---\n\n**ARGUMENT 3**  \nCore Claim: Broad institutional and public ownership does not guarantee better governance and can lead to inefficiencies and lack of accountability.  \nSupport Type: PRINCIPLE  \nSupport Details:  \n- Public ownership tends to dilute responsibility because there is no single person or entity accountable for outcomes. This was evident in the failure of state-owned enterprises in the UK during the 1970s, where inefficiency and bureaucracy plagued industries like coal and rail.  \n- Institutional investors, while theoretically responsible, are often driven by quarterly financial returns rather than long-term societal impact. For example, BlackRock, one of the largest institutional shareholders globally, has faced criticism for prioritizing profits over environmental sustainability despite its public commitments (Harvard Business Review, 2021).  \n- A lack of clear accountability mechanisms in broad ownership structures makes it harder to enforce ethical practices or respond to societal concerns effectively.  \n\nConnection: Public and institutional ownership models fail to address the root problems of governance and accountability, making them inferior alternatives to concentrated private control in ensuring responsible management of social media platforms.  \n\n---\n\n**SYNTHESIS**  \n- Together, these arguments create a unified case against limiting individual shareholding. Property rights form the ethical foundation of the opposition, while evidence from real-world cases demonstrates the practical advantages of concentrated control. Finally, the principle of accountability highlights the flaws in proposed alternative ownership models.  \n- This combination proves that the motion would harm innovation, stability, and governance in social media platforms, ultimately undermining both individual liberties and societal welfare.  \n- The real-world impact of this debate is significant: restricting ownership rights could set a dangerous precedent for other industries, threatening the very fabric of free-market economies and stifling technological progress.  \n\n\n\n",
      "rebuttal": "**OPPOSITION REBUTTAL**\n\n---\n\n### **CLASH POINT 1**  \n**Original Claim:**  \n\"Limiting individual shareholding in social media platforms to 15% voting rights ensures platforms prioritize societal well-being over private profit. The principle of 'public utility' holds that entities essential to the functioning of society should not be controlled by private actors whose sole motive is profit maximization.\"  \n\n**Challenge Type:**  \n**Principle Critique**  \n\n**Challenge:**  \nThe principle of \"public utility\" is fundamentally flawed when applied to social media platforms. While entities like water and electricity are essential for basic survival and have no substitutes, social media platforms operate in competitive markets with numerous alternatives. Users can switch platforms based on dissatisfaction with governance or content policies\u2014a luxury they don\u2019t have with utilities. Furthermore, the distinction between essential services and optional platforms undermines the applicability of this principle. Social media is not a necessity but a choice, and applying \"public utility\" regulations risks stifling innovation in an industry driven by competition and user preferences.  \n\nMoreover, the proposition's reliance on antitrust laws as precedent is misplaced. Antitrust laws were designed to prevent monopolistic practices that harm consumers through price manipulation or restricted access. Social media platforms, however, offer free services funded by advertising, meaning traditional antitrust concerns about consumer harm are less applicable. Limiting individual shareholding doesn\u2019t address actual monopolistic behaviors (e.g., market dominance) but instead targets ownership structures, which are unrelated to the core issues of antitrust regulation.  \n\n**Impact:**  \nWinning this point disproves the foundational principle of the proposition\u2019s case. If \"public utility\" cannot be validly applied to social media platforms, then the justification for capping individual shareholding collapses entirely. Without this principle, the proposition must rely exclusively on weaker evidence-based arguments, making their case far less compelling.\n\n---\n\n### **CLASH POINT 2**  \n**Original Claim:**  \n\"Broadening ownership through institutional and public participation reduces the risk of authoritarian misuse and promotes democratic accountability.\"  \n\n**Challenge Type:**  \n**Counter Evidence**  \n\n**Challenge:**  \nThe proposition's claim ignores critical examples where broad institutional and public ownership failed to prevent authoritarian misuse or promote accountability. Take, for instance, the case of France T\u00e9l\u00e9com (now Orange). In the early 2000s, the French government held majority shares, yet the company faced allegations of unethical business practices, including forced employee layoffs under false pretenses. This demonstrates that institutional and public ownership does not inherently guarantee ethical behavior or democratic accountability.  \n\nAdditionally, the proposition's use of Meta's role in the 2016 U.S. election as evidence of authoritarian misuse is misleading. While Meta\u2019s handling of misinformation was problematic, it stemmed from flawed algorithms and content moderation policies\u2014not from Mark Zuckerberg\u2019s concentrated control. Shifting decision-making power to institutional stakeholders wouldn\u2019t solve these algorithmic problems, as they require technical expertise rather than diluted ownership structures.  \n\nInstead, consider Twitter\u2019s example post-acquisition under Elon Musk. Despite chaotic decision-making, the rapid transparency and responsiveness to user concerns (e.g., reintroducing legacy blue checkmarks and open-sourcing algorithms) highlight how strong leadership can adapt quickly to crises\u2014a trait absent in bureaucratic, broad ownership models.  \n\n**Impact:**  \nBy providing counterexamples where broad ownership failed and demonstrating that authoritarian misuse stems from operational issues rather than ownership concentration, I dismantle the proposition\u2019s claim. This undermines their argument that diversifying ownership is the solution to social media governance challenges.\n\n---\n\n### **CLASH POINT 3**  \n**Original Claim:**  \n\"Institutional and public ownership can drive innovation and inclusivity by prioritizing long-term societal benefits over short-term profits.\"  \n\n**Challenge Type:**  \n**Evidence Critique**  \n\n**Challenge:**  \nThe proposition's evidence relies heavily on irrelevant or poorly contextualized examples. For instance, NASA\u2019s Apollo program succeeded due to its mission-driven structure and government funding\u2014not because of public ownership. Similarly, Norway\u2019s sovereign wealth fund operates in a completely different context, investing in diverse industries globally rather than managing day-to-day operations of specific firms. Neither example provides a viable blueprint for governing social media platforms.  \n\nFurthermore, the proposition\u2019s comparison of Wikipedia to platforms like Instagram is flawed. Wikipedia\u2019s success stems from its unique non-profit model and volunteer-driven contributions, which are incompatible with the revenue-driven needs of social media companies. Instagram\u2019s focus on monetizable features reflects market realities, not moral failings, and serves legitimate business interests.  \n\nFinally, the proposition overlooks the inefficiencies inherent in institutional ownership. BlackRock, for example, prioritizes quarterly profits despite public commitments to sustainability, proving that institutional investors aren\u2019t automatically aligned with societal goals.  \n\n**Impact:**  \nWinning this point exposes the weak and irrelevant evidence used to support the proposition\u2019s innovation-focused argument. It shows that institutional and public ownership does not inherently foster innovation or inclusivity, further weakening the proposition\u2019s overall case.\n\n---\n\n### **DEFENSIVE ANALYSIS**  \n\n**Vulnerabilities:**  \n- My defense of property rights may be challenged by claims that social media platforms\u2019 societal impact justifies regulatory intervention.  \n- The proposition could argue that my counterexamples of failed broad ownership are exceptions rather than the rule.  \n\n**Additional Support:**  \n- Reinforce the importance of property rights by citing historical examples where regulatory overreach stifled innovation (e.g., India\u2019s License Raj era).  \n- Highlight how institutional ownership often prioritizes financial returns over societal welfare, citing additional examples like Vanguard\u2019s environmental record.  \n\n**Why We Prevail:**  \nMy responses are stronger because they directly critique the foundational principles and evidence of the proposition\u2019s arguments. By providing specific counterexamples and highlighting logical inconsistencies, I expose weaknesses in their case while bolstering my own arguments with robust evidence and reasoning.  \n\n---\n\n### **WEIGHING**  \n\n**Key Clash Points:**  \n1. The validity of applying \"public utility\" principles to social media platforms.  \n2. Whether broad ownership effectively prevents misuse and promotes accountability.  \n3. The relationship between ownership structure and innovation/inclusivity.  \n\n**Why We Win:**  \nI win the key clash points by disproving the \"public utility\" principle, providing concrete counterexamples to the proposition\u2019s evidence, and exposing the irrelevance of their innovation claims. Collectively, these victories undermine the entire foundation of the proposition\u2019s case, leaving them without sufficient justification for limiting individual shareholding.  \n\n**Overall Impact:**  \nWinning these points proves that capping individual shareholding at 15% would harm innovation, stability, and governance without delivering the promised societal benefits. This outcome decisively supports the opposition\u2019s stance against the motion.  \n\n---\n\n",
      "closing": "**FINAL SPEECH: OPPOSITION SIDE**\n\n---\n\n### **FRAMING**\n\n**Core Questions:**\n1. Should individual property rights be restricted in the name of regulating social media platforms?\n2. Does concentrated private control inherently harm societal welfare, or can it provide unique benefits?\n3. Are institutional and public ownership models truly superior alternatives for governing social media platforms?\n\nThese questions expose the fundamental tension in this debate: whether we prioritize the rights of individuals to own and manage private assets (opposition) or subordinate property rights to vague claims about public utility (proposition). The key decision for judges is whether the harms caused by social media platforms stem from ownership structures\u2014or from deeper operational and governance issues. The motion must be defeated because it overreaches by targeting property rights without proving that limiting shareholding addresses the actual problems.\n\n---\n\n### **KEY CLASHES**\n\n#### **Clash 1: Property Rights vs. Public Utility**\n**Quote:**  \nProposition: \"Limiting individual shareheading ensures platforms prioritize societal well-being over private profit using the principle of public utility.\"  \nOpposition: \"The principle of property rights holds that individuals should have the freedom to own and control private assets without artificial restrictions.\"  \n\n**Our Case Strength:**  \n- The proposition\u2019s reliance on \"public utility\" fails because social media platforms are not analogous to essential utilities like water or electricity. Social media users have alternatives and agency to leave platforms they find objectionable. This undermines the applicability of the principle of \"public utility.\"  \n- Historical precedents cited by the proposition, such as antitrust laws, focus on consumer harm through monopolies and price gouging\u2014issues irrelevant to free, ad-supported social media platforms.  \n\n**Their Response Gaps:**  \n- The proposition failed to address the distinction between essential services and optional platforms. They also ignored that antitrust laws regulate market behavior, not ownership structures.  \n- By misapplying the public utility principle, they left their argument vulnerable to critique on logical and evidential grounds.  \n\n**Crucial Impact:**  \nIf we win this clash, the proposition's ethical foundation collapses. Without the public utility principle, they lose the justification for restricting property rights, which makes the motion indefensible.\n\n---\n\n#### **Clash 2: Accountability and Stability Under Ownership Models**\n**Quote:**  \nProposition: \"Broadening ownership reduces authoritarian misuse and promotes democratic accountability.\"  \nOpposition: \"Broad ownership fails to guarantee better governance and often leads to inefficiencies and lack of accountability.\"  \n\n**Our Case Strength:**  \n- We provided concrete counterexamples, such as France T\u00e9l\u00e9com, where institutional ownership failed to prevent unethical practices. Similarly, Norway\u2019s sovereign wealth fund operates in a vastly different context and cannot serve as a blueprint for social media governance.  \n- Twitter under Elon Musk shows how strong leadership can respond dynamically to crises, contrasting with the sluggish decision-making typical of broad ownership models.  \n\n**Their Response Gaps:**  \n- The proposition failed to refute that Meta\u2019s issues stemmed from algorithmic flaws, not Mark Zuckerberg\u2019s ownership. They also ignored how institutional ownership prioritizes short-term profits, undermining their claim about long-term societal benefits.  \n- Their examples, such as Wikipedia, are irrelevant to profit-driven social media platforms.  \n\n**Crucial Impact:**  \nWinning this clash demonstrates that broad ownership does not inherently solve governance challenges. It reveals the impracticality of the proposition\u2019s proposed solution, weakening their case significantly.\n\n---\n\n#### **Clash 3: Innovation and Inclusivity Under Ownership Structures**\n**Quote:**  \nProposition: \"Institutional and public ownership drives innovation by prioritizing long-term societal benefits over short-term profits.\"  \nOpposition: \"Broad ownership often stifles innovation due to inefficiency and lack of clear accountability.\"  \n\n**Our Case Strength:**  \n- We exposed the irrelevance of NASA\u2019s Apollo program and Norway\u2019s sovereign wealth fund as examples for social media governance. Neither proves that public or institutional ownership fosters innovation within the context of social media platforms.  \n- BlackRock\u2019s prioritization of quarterly returns, despite public commitments to sustainability, highlights the disconnect between institutional ownership and actual societal impact.  \n\n**Their Response Gaps:**  \n- The proposition ignored that Instagram\u2019s focus on monetizable features reflects market realities, not moral failings.  \n- Their reliance on Wikipedia\u2019s success is invalid because its non-profit model is incompatible with the financial demands of social media platforms.  \n\n**Crucial Impact:**  \nThis clash centers on innovation\u2014a key selling point for the proposition. By showing that their examples are irrelevant or flawed, we expose the weakness of their innovation argument, further solidifying our case.\n\n---\n\n### **VOTING ISSUES**\n\n#### **Priority Analysis**\n- The clash over property rights vs. public utility is the most critical because it undermines the ethical basis for the motion. Without this principle, the entire proposition collapses.  \n- The clash over accountability and stability highlights the impracticality of the proposition\u2019s proposed solution, demonstrating that broad ownership fails to deliver promised benefits.  \n- The clash over innovation and inclusivity reinforces the point that alternative ownership models do not inherently foster innovation, weakening the proposition\u2019s practical appeal.  \n\n#### **Case Proof**\n- Winning the property rights clash disproves the ethical justification for the motion.  \n- Discrediting the proposition\u2019s examples of accountability and stability shows that broad ownership does not solve governance issues.  \n- Exposing the irrelevance of their innovation examples leaves their practical arguments unsupported.  \n- These wins collectively demonstrate that the motion is neither ethically nor practically justified.  \n\n#### **Final Weighing**\n- Any minor weaknesses in our arguments, such as gaps in rebuttals to institutional ownership models, do not undermine our overall case.  \n- Our victories on the key clashes establish that the motion harms innovation, stability, and governance without delivering promised societal benefits.  \n- The opposition prevails decisively by proving that limiting individual shareholding is an unnecessary and harmful intervention into property rights with no guarantee of positive outcomes.\n\n---\n\n**Final Statement:**  \nThis House would not limit individual shareholding in social media platforms because doing so violates property rights, fails to address the root causes of governance challenges, and risks stifling innovation and stability. The proposition\u2019s case rests on flawed principles and unsupported evidence, leaving their motion indefensible. Vote for the opposition to uphold freedom, accountability, and progress.  \n\n"

The clarity and relevance of these examples make my case robust under evaluation criteria like evidence quality and logical validity. Furthermore, my synthesis ties arguments together cohesively, emphasizing practical impact.  \n\nHowever, my opponent could win under these circumstances:  \n- They may counter that limiting individual shareholding stifles innovation and entrepreneurial incentives, citing examples like Elon Musk\u2019s transformative leadership at Twitter. If they effectively argue that private control drives groundbreaking changes faster than institutional oversight, judges might find their case compelling.
