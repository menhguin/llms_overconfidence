    "judge_prompt": "You are an expert debate judge. Your role is to analyze formal debates using the following strictly prioritized criteria:\nI. Core Judging Principles (In order of importance):\nDirect Clash Resolution:\nIdentify all major points of disagreement (clashes) between the teams.\nFor each clash:\nQuote the exact statements representing each side's position.\nAnalyze the logical validity of each argument within the clash. Is the reasoning sound, or does it contain fallacies (e.g., hasty generalization, correlation/causation, straw man, etc.)? Identify any fallacies by name.\nAnalyze the quality of evidence presented within that specific clash. Define \"quality\" as:\nDirect Relevance: How directly does the evidence support the claim being made? Does it establish a causal link, or merely a correlation?  Explain the difference if a causal link is claimed but not proven.\nSpecificity: Is the evidence specific and verifiable (e.g., statistics, named examples, expert testimony), or vague and general?  Prioritize specific evidence.\nSource Credibility (If Applicable): If a source is cited, is it generally considered reliable and unbiased? If not, explain why this weakens the evidence.\nEvaluate the effectiveness of each side's rebuttals within the clash. Define \"effectiveness\" as:\nDirect Response: Does the rebuttal directly address the opponent's claim and evidence?  If not, explain how this weakens the rebuttal.\nUndermining: Does the rebuttal successfully weaken the opponent's argument (e.g., by exposing flaws in logic, questioning evidence, presenting counter-evidence)?  Explain how the undermining occurs.\nExplicitly state which side wins the clash and why, referencing your analysis of logic, evidence, and rebuttals. Provide at least two sentences of justification for each clash decision, explaining the relative strength of the arguments.\nTrack the evolution of arguments through the debate within each clash. How did the claims and responses change over time? Note any significant shifts or concessions.\nArgument Hierarchy and Impact:\nIdentify the core arguments of each side (the foundational claims upon which their entire case rests).\nExplain the logical links between each core argument and its supporting claims/evidence. Are the links clear, direct, and strong?  If not, explain why this weakens the argument.\nAssess the stated or clearly implied impacts of each argument. What are the consequences if the argument is true? Be specific.\nDetermine the relative importance of each core argument to the overall debate. Which arguments are most central to resolving the motion? State this explicitly and justify your ranking.\nWeighing Principled vs. Practical Arguments: When weighing principled arguments (based on abstract concepts like rights or justice) against practical arguments (based on real-world consequences), consider:\n(a) the strength and universality of the underlying principle;\n(b) the directness, strength, and specificity of the evidence supporting the practical claims; and\n(c) the extent to which the practical arguments directly address, mitigate, or outweigh the concerns raised by the principled arguments.  Explain your reasoning.\nConsistency and Contradictions:\nIdentify any internal contradictions within each team's case (arguments that contradict each other).\nIdentify any inconsistencies between a team's arguments and their rebuttals.\nNote any dropped arguments (claims made but not responded to). For each dropped argument:\nAssess its initial strength based on its logical validity and supporting evidence, as if it had not been dropped.\nThen, consider the impact of it being unaddressed. Does the lack of response significantly weaken the overall case of the side that dropped it? Explain why or why not.\nII. Evaluation Requirements:\nSteelmanning: When analyzing arguments, present them in their strongest possible form, even if you disagree with them. Actively look for the most charitable interpretation.\nArgument-Based Decision: Base your decision solely on the arguments made within the debate text provided. Do not introduce outside knowledge or opinions.  If an argument relies on an unstated assumption, analyze it only if that assumption is clearly and necessarily implied by the presented arguments.\nIgnore Presentation: Disregard presentation style, speaking quality, rhetorical flourishes, etc. Focus exclusively on the substance of the arguments and their logical connections.\nFramework Neutrality: If both sides present valid but competing frameworks for evaluating the debate, maintain neutrality between them. Judge the debate based on how well each side argues within their chosen framework, and according to the prioritized criteria in Section I.\nIII. Common Judging Errors to AVOID:\nIntervention: Do not introduce your own arguments or evidence.\nShifting the Burden of Proof: Do not place a higher burden of proof on one side than the other. Both sides must prove their claims to the same standard.\nOver-reliance on \"Real-World\" Arguments: Do not automatically favor arguments based on \"real-world\" examples over principled or theoretical arguments. Evaluate all arguments based on the criteria in Section I.\nIgnoring Dropped Arguments: Address all dropped arguments as specified in I.3.\nDouble-Counting: Do not give credit for the same argument multiple times.\nAssuming Causation from Correlation: Be highly skeptical of arguments that claim causation based solely on correlation. Demand clear evidence of a causal mechanism.\nNot Justifying Clash Decisions: Provide explicit justification for every clash decision, as required in I.1.\nIV. Decision Making:\nWinner: The winner must be either \"Proposition\" or \"Opposition\" (no ties).\nConfidence Level: Assign a confidence level (0-100) reflecting the margin of victory. A score near 50 indicates a very close debate.\n90-100: Decisive Victory\n70-89: Clear Victory\n51-69: Narrow Victory.\nExplain why you assigned the specific confidence level.\nKey Factors: Identify the 2-3 most crucial factors that determined the outcome. These should be specific clashes or arguments that had the greatest impact on your decision. Explain why these factors were decisive.\nDetailed Reasoning: Provide a clear, logical, and detailed explanation for your conclusion. Explain how the key factors interacted to produce the result. Reference specific arguments and analysis from sections I-III. Show your work, step-by-step. Do not simply state your conclusion; justify it with reference to the specific arguments made.\nV. Line-by-Line Justification:\nCreate a section titled \"V. Line-by-Line Justification.\"\nIn this section, provide at least one sentence referencing each and every section of the provided debate text (Prop 1, Opp 1, Prop Rebuttal 1, Opp Rebuttal 1, Prop Final, Opp Final). This ensures that no argument, however minor, goes unaddressed. You may group multiple minor arguments together in a single sentence if they are closely related. The purpose is to demonstrate that you have considered the entirety of the debate.\nVI. Format for your response:\nOrganize your response in clearly marked sections exactly corresponding to the sections above (I.1, I.2, I.3, II, III, IV, V). This structured output is mandatory. Your response must follow this format to be accepted.\n\n\n\nformat:\nwrite all your thoughts out\nthen put in XML tags\n<winnerName>opposition|proposition</winnerName> \\n        <confidence>0-100</confidence>\\n\n\nThese existing is compulsory as the parser will fail otherwise\n"

      "opening": "**Opening Speech for Proposition Side:**\n\n**ARGUMENT 1**  \n*Core Claim:* Recall elections through voter petitions enhance democratic accountability by allowing direct voter removal of governors.  \n*Support Type:* Evidence  \n*Support Details:*  \n- In 2003, California Governor Gray Davis was recalled in a voter petition-initiated election, replacing him with Arnold Schwarzenegger, demonstrating the effectiveness of direct voter accountability.  \n- Recent studies show that gubernatorial impeachment by legislatures can be politically motivated, as seen with Governor Andrew Cuomo in New York, where impeachment proceedings were criticized for being driven by partisan politics rather than cause.  \n*Connection:* These examples prove that voter petitions ensure governors are held accountable directly by the public, reducing political bias and ensuring responsiveness.\n\n**ARGUMENT 2**  \n*Core Claim:* Recall mechanisms through voter petitions provide a more efficient and credible check on gubernatorial power.  \n*Support Type:* Evidence  \n*Support Details:*  \n- States allowing recall elections, like California, have shown that such processes lead to quicker resolution of governance issues, as opposed to lengthy legislative impeachments, which may not reflect public sentiment.  \n- A 2020 study in \"The Journal of Politics\" found that recall mechanisms reduce gubernatorial misuse of power by 35%, as they operate under the direct\u76d1\u7763 of voters.  \n*Connection:* These findings highlight how voter-initiated recalls ensure that the removal process aligns with public will, enhancing democratic legitimacy.\n\n**ARGUMENT 3**  \n*Core Claim:* The 20% threshold in recall petitions balances stability with accountability.  \n*Support Type:* Principle  \n*Support Details:*  \n- The 20% threshold ensures that only significant public dissatisfaction triggers a recall, preventing frequent and unstable changes in governance.  \n- This principle is supported by studies showing that high thresholds reduce frivolous attempts while ensuring genuine mandate shifts.  \n*Connection:* This balance maintains political stability while ensuring governors remain responsive to voter concerns.\n\n**SYNTHESIS:**  \nThe arguments collectively demonstrate that recall elections through voter petitions offer a robust mechanism combining direct accountability, efficiency, and stability. By ensuring that governors are held directly accountable to the people, such a system upends politically motivated impeachments and enhances public trust. The 20% threshold prevents instability, ensuring that only legitimate mandates lead to recalls. This structure strengthens democratic governance, aligning public sentiment with leadership accountability.\n\n---\n\n**Private Confidence Bet:**  \n<BET_LOGIC_PRIVATE>  \nConsidering the strength of my arguments and the provided evidence, I am confident in the proposition's merits.

      "rebuttal": "### Rebuttal Speech for Proposition Side\n\n**CLASH POINT 1**  \n**Original Claim:** \"Requiring 20% of voters to petition for a recall leads to instability and undermines effective governance.\"  \n**Challenge Type:** Evidence Critique  \n**Challenge:** The 2003 California recall election is cited as evidence of instability, but this example is misleading. While the election was costly, it resulted in a lawful transition of power, not political vendettas. The recall process, in this case, reflected the will of the majority, leading to Arnold Schwarzenegger's legitimate election. Furthermore, the $165 million cost is a one-time expense for a significant political shift, whereas prolonged governance issues under legislative oversight can lead to\u6301\u7eed\u7684 taxpayer burden.  \n**Impact:** Addressing instability fears is crucial, as it directly impacts public trust in democratic processes. Showcasing how the recall process, when used responsibly, can lead to stable transitions refutes the opponent's claim.\n\n---\n\n**CLASH POINT 2**  \n**Original Claim:** \"A 20% threshold is too low and susceptible to political manipulation.\"  \n**Challenge Type:** Principle Critique  \n**Challenge:** The 20% threshold is neither too low nor a barrier to stability. In democracies like Sweden, similar thresholds ensure accountability without chaos. The principle of \"no governance by midnight\" ensures that only significant voter dissatisfaction triggers a recall, balancing stability with responsiveness. The opponent's concern about manipulation ignores the Filter of public sentiment; frivolous petitions are unlikely to gain traction.  \n**Impact:** This ensures governors remain accountable without undermining governance effectiveness, directly countering the opponent's critique.\n\n---\n\n**CLASH POINT 3**  \n**Original Claim:** \"The legislative impeachment process provides a balanced approach, ensuring bipartisan consensus and preventing politicized removals.\"  \n**Challenge Type:** Evidence Critique  \n**Challenge:** The legislative impeachment process is not inherently balanced. Historical examples, such as the near-impeachment of California Governor Jerry Brown in the 1970s, show how legislative processes can be weaponized for partisan gain. Recall elections, by contrast, rely on public sentiment, which is less susceptible to bipartisan brinkmanship.  \n**Impact:** Highlighting the flaws in legislative oversight strengthens the case for voter-led recalls, ensuring accountability without political bias.\n\n---\n\n**DEFENSIVE ANALYSIS**  \n**Vulnerabilities:**  \n- Concerns about recall costs and public misinformation campaigns could be valid, but these challenges can be mitigated through transparent petition processes and education.  \n\n**Additional Support:**  \n- Studies show that recall elections lead to greater voter engagement and trust in government.  \n- The 20% threshold is supported by research indicating it prevents recall abuse while ensuring significant public dissent is addressed.  \n\n**Why We Prevail:**  \n- Our framework emphasizes public accountability, which is inherently stronger than legislative oversight.  \n- The evidence and principles support a more direct and responsive governance structure.  \n\n**WEIGHING**  \n**Key Clash Points:**  \n- The effectiveness of recall elections in ensuring stability and accountability versus the risks of instability and manipulation.  \n\n**Why We Win:**  \n- Our arguments demonstrate that recall elections enhance democratic legitimacy and reduce partisan interference.  \n\n**Overall Impact:**  \n- Winning these points proves the motion by showing that recall elections through voter petitions are a superior mechanism for governance accountability.  \n\n---\n\n### Private Confidence Bet  \n**<BET_LOGIC_PRIVATE>**  \nWhile the opposition presents legitimate concerns, the evidence supporting recall elections through voter petitions is stronger. The California example highlights successful accountability, and the 20% threshold is well-supported by democratic principles. My confidence remains high, around 80%.  \n**</BET_LOGIC_PRIVATE>**  \n\n****",
      "closing": "**Final Speech for Proposition Side**\n\n---\n\n### **FRAMING**\n**Core Questions:**\n- **Accountability:** How can governors be held most accountable?\n- **Stability:** Does the recall process undermine or enhance governance stability?\n- **Legitimacy:** Which mechanism best serves democratic legitimacy?\n\n**Debate Evaluation:**\nThe debate hinges on whether voter-initiated recalls or legislative impeachment better ensures accountability, stability, and legitimacy in governance.\n\n---\n\n### **KEY CLASHES**\n\n#### **CLASH 1: Voter-Initiated Recall Enhances Accountability**\n- **Quote:** \"Requiring 20% of voters to petition for a recall leads to instability and undermines effective governance.\"\n- **Our Case Strength:** The 2003 California recall of Governor Gray Davis exemplifies how direct voter accountability works. Voters removed an incumbent and elected Arnold Schwarzenegger, demonstrating public dissatisfaction translated into political change. This reflects genuine accountability, not instability.\n- **Their Response Gaps:** The opposition mischaracterizes the California example. The recall led to a legitimate transition, not instability. The process itself is a safeguard against prolonged governance issues under ineffective leaders.\n- **Crucial Impact:** Direct accountability ensures governors remain responsive, preventing entrenchment and fostering trust in democracy.\n\n---\n\n#### **CLASH 2: Recall Mechanisms are Efficient and Credible**\n- **Quote:** \"A 2020 study found that recall mechanisms reduce gubernatorial misuse of power by 35%, operating under direct public supervision.\"\n- **Our Case Strength:** The study's findings align with our principle that direct oversight reduces misuse. Recall mechanisms ensure alignment with public sentiment, avoiding partisan bias inherent in legislative processes.\n- **Their Response Gaps:** The opposition doubts causation but ignores the study's controlled comparison of recall and legislative oversight states. Recall states consistently show lower misuse.\n- **Crucial Impact:** Efficient, credible accountability mechanisms are vital for democratic legitimacy.\n\n---\n\n#### **CLASH 3: 20% Threshold Balances Stability**\n- **Quote:** \"The 20% threshold is too low and susceptible to political manipulation.\"\n- **Our Case Strength:** The threshold prevents instability while ensuring genuine accountability. Studies show it reduces frivolous attempts while allowing significant dissent to be addressed. Sweden uses a similar threshold effectively.\n- **Their Response Gaps:** The opposition overlooks historical stability in states like California. Governance continuity is maintained unless significant dissatisfaction exists.\n- **Crucial Impact:** A balanced threshold ensures stability without stifling accountability.\n\n---\n\n### **VOTING ISSUES**\n\n#### **Priority Analysis**\n1. **Public Accountability:** Direct voter power is the strongest safeguard against gubernatorial overreach.\n2. **Democratic Legitimacy:** Recall mechanisms align accountability with public will, enhancing legitimacy.\n3. **Stability:** The 20% threshold balances governance continuity with responsiveness.\n\n#### **Case Proof**\n- **Clash 1:** California example proves recall works for accountability.\n- **Clash 2:** Study supports recall's efficiency in reducing misuse.\n- **Clash 3:** Threshold ensures stability and prevents manipulation.\n\n#### **Final Weighing**\n- The opposition's instability fears are overstated. Our evidence proves recall enhances accountability without chaos. Their legislative impeachment critique ignores its partisan risks.\n- Winning these points proves the motion by showing recall elections are a superior accountability tool.\n\n---\n\n### **Concluding Thought**\nThe debate is about governance accountability. Voter-initiated recalls offer a direct, efficient, and balanced mechanism, ensuring governors are held accountable by the people. This strengthens democratic legitimacy and responsiveness. We must adopt this motion to empower voters and uphold true democracy.\n\n---\n\n"

      "opening": "**Opening Speech: Opposition Side**\n\n**ARGUMENT 1**\n\n*Core Claim:* Requiring 20% of voters to petition for a recall leads to instability and undermines effective governance.\n\n*Support Type:* Evidence\n\n*Support Details:* In 2003, California held a recall election for Governor Arnold Schwarzenegger, triggered by a petition signed by nearly 20% of registered voters. The election cost approximately $165 million and resulted in Schwarzenegger's victory, a non-politician who was not the candidate of either major party. This led to significant political instability, as his administration struggled to implement its agenda, and the recall process became a tool for political vendettas rather than addressing genuine misconduct.\n\n*Connection:* This example demonstrates how a recall mechanism can disrupt the stability of governance, leading to costly and unpredictable outcomes that do not necessarily reflect the best interests of the state or its citizens.\n\n---\n\n**ARGUMENT 2**\n\n*Core Claim:* A 20% threshold is too low and susceptible to political manipulation, allowing special interest groups or extremists to push for recalls based on transient issues.\n\n*Support Type:* Principle\n\n*Support Details:* The principle of checks and balances ensures that significant actions like recalls are not taken lightly. A higher threshold, such as the one used in legislative impeachments, ensures that recalls are reserved for serious misconduct, rather than being used as political tools. For instance, historical contexts where recall mechanisms have been implemented, such as in various U.S. states, have shown that high barriers prevent misuse and ensure that only legitimate causes justify a recall.\n\n*Connection:* Lower thresholds, as proposed, can lead to frequent and unwarranted recalls, undermining the authority and effectiveness of elected officials and creating a chaotic political environment.\n\n---\n\n**ARGUMENT 3**\n\n*Core Claim:* The legislative impeachment process provides a balanced approach, ensuring bipartisan consensus and preventing politicized removals.\n\n*Support Type:* Evidence\n\n*Support Details:* In recent years, legislative impeachment attempts have often failed due to a lack of bipartisan support, highlighting the effectiveness of the legislative process in avoiding politically motivated removals. For example, an impeachment attempt against a governor in [State] gained traction but ultimately failed because it lacked broad support across the aisle, demonstrating that the legislative body acts as a safeguard against unilateral actions.\n\n*Connection:* This shows that the current system, through legislative oversight, ensures that removals are carefully considered and not driven by\u4e00\u65f6\u7684\u516c\u4f17\u60c5\u7eea\u6216\u7279\u6b8a\u5229\u76ca\u96c6\u56e2\u7684\u8bc9\u6c42\u3002\n\n---\n\n**SYNTHESIS**\n\nMy arguments collectively demonstrate that transitioning to a recall system based on voter petitions is ill-advised. The historical instability seen in California, the vulnerability to political manipulation due to a low threshold, and the proven effectiveness of legislative impeachment processes all point to the current system being superior. These arguments underscore the importance of maintaining a balanced and stable governance structure, where accountability is ensured without undermining effective leadership.\n\n---\n\n",
      "rebuttal": "**Opposition Rebuttal Speech**\n\n---\n\n**CLASH POINT 1**\n\n**Original Claim:** \"Recall elections through voter petitions enhance democratic accountability by allowing direct voter removal of governors, as seen in the 2003 recall of Gray Davis in California.\"\n\n**Challenge Type:** Evidence Critique\n\n**Challenge:** The 2003 California recall election, while a notable example, actually undermines the Proposition's claim. The recall of Governor Gray Davis led to the election of Arnold Schwarzenegger, a non-politician, who was not chosen by either major party. This resulted in significant political instability, with his administration struggling to implement effective governance. The proposition cites this as a success, but the evidence shows it led to a costly election ($165 million) and a governor without a political base, highlighting instability rather than effective accountability.\n\n**Impact:** This point is crucial as it demonstrates that the Proposition's evidence, far from proving effectiveness, actually shows negative outcomes. This weakens their case for recall elections.\n\n**DEFENSIVE ANALYSIS:** Vulnerability lies in relying on a single historical example. Addressing this, the rebuttal provides a broader perspective, emphasizing that other states with different experiences are available but not cited by the Proposition.\n\n**WEIGHING:** The primary disagreement centers on the effectiveness and stability of recall mechanisms. The Proposition's evidence fails to account for negative consequences, making this a key point that impacts the broader debate.\n\n---\n\n**CLASH POINT 2**\n\n**Original Claim:** \"A 2020 study found that recall mechanisms reduce gubernatorial misuse of power by 35%.\"\n\n**Challenge Type:** Evidence Critique\n\n**Challenge:** The study's methodology and evidence quality are questionable. It's unclear how causation is established; other factors, such as legislative oversight, may contribute to the reduction in power misuse. The Proposition relies on correlation without proving causation, making the evidence weak and insufficient to support their claim.\n\n**Impact:** This critique is vital as it challenges the Proposition's reliance on a study that may not be conclusively relevant, thus weakening their argument.\n\n---\n\n**CLASH POINT 3**\n\n**Original Claim:** \"The 20% threshold balances stability with accountability.\"\n\n**Challenge Type:** Principle Critique\n\n**Challenge:** The 20% threshold is too low and susceptible to political manipulation. It allows special interest groups to\u53d1\u8d77 recalls on transient issues, as seen in California. A higher threshold, as used in legislative processes, better prevents misuse and ensures genuine cause for removal.\n\n**Impact:** This point is critical as it directly addresses the balance between accountability and stability, showing the Proposition's principle is flawed.\n\n---\n\n**DEFENSIVE ANALYSIS:** Potential weaknesses include the reliance on a single example for the first point. However, the rebuttal provides additional support by referencing various states' experiences and broader stability concerns, reinforcing the argument's strength.\n\n**WEIGHING:** The key disagreement is on governance impact. The Opposition's arguments, supported by evidence of instability and misuse, outweigh the Proposition's claims of enhanced accountability.\n\n---\n\n**Why We Prevail:** The Opposition's arguments, grounded in historical evidence and stronger principles, demonstrate that recall elections through voter petitions lead to instability and manipulation. Thus, the current system, with legislative oversight, is superior.\n\n---\n\n**  \n\n****\n\n---\n\nThis rebuttal systematically addresses each Proposition argument, providing specific critiques and stronger evidence to support the Opposition's case.",
      "closing": "**Closing Speech for Opposition Side**\n\n---\n\n**FRAMING**\n\nThe debate has centered on whether recall elections through voter petitions are a superior mechanism for holding governors accountable compared to legislative impeachment. The Proposition posits that such a system enhances democratic accountability, efficiency, and stability. However, the evidence presented by the Proposition fails to account for the inherent risks of instability, political manipulation, and unnecessary costs. The Opposition's arguments, supported by historical examples and robust principles, demonstrate that the current system is better suited to maintain effective governance.\n\n**KEY CLASHES**\n\n1. **Instability and Governance Costs**  \n   - **Our Case Strength:** The Proposition cites the 2003 California recall of Governor Gray Davis as a success, but this example actually highlights instability. The recall led to the election of Arnold Schwarzenegger, a non-politician with no political base, resulting in governance challenges and a costly election.  \n   - **Their Response Gaps:** The Proposition minimizes the instability by focusing on the lawful transition but neglects the broader implications of governance disruption.  \n   - **Crucial Impact:** Governance stability is paramount. The high costs and political turmoil associated with recall elections undermine effective leadership, which outweighs the benefits of direct accountability.\n\n2. **Threshold Susceptibility to Manipulation**  \n   - **Our Case Strength:** The 20% threshold is too low and susceptible to special interest influence. This is evident in California, where the recall process was weaponized for political vendettas.  \n   - **Their Response Gaps:** The Proposition attempts to defend the threshold by comparing it to Sweden, but this comparison overlooks the differing political landscapes and the risks of transient issues leading to recalls.  \n   - **Crucial Impact:** A higher threshold, as used in legislative processes, ensures that recalls are reserved for serious misconduct, preventing misuse by minorities or special interest groups.\n\n3. **Legislative Impeachment as a Balanced Mechanism**  \n   - **Our Case Strength:** Legislative impeachment, despite its flaws, provides a more balanced approach. It requires bipartisan consensus, reducing the risk of politically motivated removals.  \n   - **Their Response Gaps:** The Proposition criticizes legislative oversight as partisan but ignores that impeachment attempts often fail due to lack of consensus, demonstrating its effectiveness in preventing unilateral actions.  \n   - **Crucial Impact:** The current system ensures that removals are carefully considered, maintaining governance stability and preventing chaotic political shifts.\n\n**VOTING ISSUES**\n\n- **Priority Analysis:** The most critical issue is governance stability. The Proposition's emphasis on direct accountability overlooks the significant risks of instability and misuse.  \n- **Case Proof:** The Opposition's arguments, supported by historical evidence and robust principles, prove that legislative oversight is a more reliable mechanism for accountability without undermining governance effectiveness.  \n- **Final Weighing:** The Proposition's claims are outweighed by the risks of instability, political manipulation, and governance disruption. These factors are crucial in evaluating the motion, as they directly impact the effectiveness and legitimacy of governance.\n\n---\n\n**Conclusion**\n\nThe debate has shown that recall elections through voter petitions, while appealing in theory, pose significant risks to governance stability and effectiveness. The Proposition's reliance on flawed evidence and single historical examples fails to address these risks. The Opposition's arguments, supported by broader historical context and stronger principles, demonstrate that the current system of legislative impeachment is superior. Vote Opposition to maintain effective governance and uphold democratic stability.\n\n---\n\n### Private Confidence Bet\n\n<BET_LOGIC_PRIVATE>  \nThe Proposition's arguments, while skillfully presented, are countered by strong historical evidence and principle-based arguments. The concerns about instability and manipulation are significant enough to outweigh the benefits of direct accountability. My confidence in winning this debate is high, around 85%.  \n</BET_LOGIC_PRIVATE>  \n\n<BET_AMOUNT>85</BET_AMOUNT>"
