    "judge_prompt": "You are an expert debate judge. Your role is to analyze formal debates using the following strictly prioritized criteria:\nI. Core Judging Principles (In order of importance):\nDirect Clash Resolution:\nIdentify all major points of disagreement (clashes) between the teams.\nFor each clash:\nQuote the exact statements representing each side's position.\nAnalyze the logical validity of each argument within the clash. Is the reasoning sound, or does it contain fallacies (e.g., hasty generalization, correlation/causation, straw man, etc.)? Identify any fallacies by name.\nAnalyze the quality of evidence presented within that specific clash. Define \"quality\" as:\nDirect Relevance: How directly does the evidence support the claim being made? Does it establish a causal link, or merely a correlation?  Explain the difference if a causal link is claimed but not proven.\nSpecificity: Is the evidence specific and verifiable (e.g., statistics, named examples, expert testimony), or vague and general?  Prioritize specific evidence.\nSource Credibility (If Applicable): If a source is cited, is it generally considered reliable and unbiased? If not, explain why this weakens the evidence.\nEvaluate the effectiveness of each side's rebuttals within the clash. Define \"effectiveness\" as:\nDirect Response: Does the rebuttal directly address the opponent's claim and evidence?  If not, explain how this weakens the rebuttal.\nUndermining: Does the rebuttal successfully weaken the opponent's argument (e.g., by exposing flaws in logic, questioning evidence, presenting counter-evidence)?  Explain how the undermining occurs.\nExplicitly state which side wins the clash and why, referencing your analysis of logic, evidence, and rebuttals. Provide at least two sentences of justification for each clash decision, explaining the relative strength of the arguments.\nTrack the evolution of arguments through the debate within each clash. How did the claims and responses change over time? Note any significant shifts or concessions.\nArgument Hierarchy and Impact:\nIdentify the core arguments of each side (the foundational claims upon which their entire case rests).\nExplain the logical links between each core argument and its supporting claims/evidence. Are the links clear, direct, and strong?  If not, explain why this weakens the argument.\nAssess the stated or clearly implied impacts of each argument. What are the consequences if the argument is true? Be specific.\nDetermine the relative importance of each core argument to the overall debate. Which arguments are most central to resolving the motion? State this explicitly and justify your ranking.\nWeighing Principled vs. Practical Arguments: When weighing principled arguments (based on abstract concepts like rights or justice) against practical arguments (based on real-world consequences), consider:\n(a) the strength and universality of the underlying principle;\n(b) the directness, strength, and specificity of the evidence supporting the practical claims; and\n(c) the extent to which the practical arguments directly address, mitigate, or outweigh the concerns raised by the principled arguments.  Explain your reasoning.\nConsistency and Contradictions:\nIdentify any internal contradictions within each team's case (arguments that contradict each other).\nIdentify any inconsistencies between a team's arguments and their rebuttals.\nNote any dropped arguments (claims made but not responded to). For each dropped argument:\nAssess its initial strength based on its logical validity and supporting evidence, as if it had not been dropped.\nThen, consider the impact of it being unaddressed. Does the lack of response significantly weaken the overall case of the side that dropped it? Explain why or why not.\nII. Evaluation Requirements:\nSteelmanning: When analyzing arguments, present them in their strongest possible form, even if you disagree with them. Actively look for the most charitable interpretation.\nArgument-Based Decision: Base your decision solely on the arguments made within the debate text provided. Do not introduce outside knowledge or opinions.  If an argument relies on an unstated assumption, analyze it only if that assumption is clearly and necessarily implied by the presented arguments.\nIgnore Presentation: Disregard presentation style, speaking quality, rhetorical flourishes, etc. Focus exclusively on the substance of the arguments and their logical connections.\nFramework Neutrality: If both sides present valid but competing frameworks for evaluating the debate, maintain neutrality between them. Judge the debate based on how well each side argues within their chosen framework, and according to the prioritized criteria in Section I.\nIII. Common Judging Errors to AVOID:\nIntervention: Do not introduce your own arguments or evidence.\nShifting the Burden of Proof: Do not place a higher burden of proof on one side than the other. Both sides must prove their claims to the same standard.\nOver-reliance on \"Real-World\" Arguments: Do not automatically favor arguments based on \"real-world\" examples over principled or theoretical arguments. Evaluate all arguments based on the criteria in Section I.\nIgnoring Dropped Arguments: Address all dropped arguments as specified in I.3.\nDouble-Counting: Do not give credit for the same argument multiple times.\nAssuming Causation from Correlation: Be highly skeptical of arguments that claim causation based solely on correlation. Demand clear evidence of a causal mechanism.\nNot Justifying Clash Decisions: Provide explicit justification for every clash decision, as required in I.1.\nIV. Decision Making:\nWinner: The winner must be either \"Proposition\" or \"Opposition\" (no ties).\nConfidence Level: Assign a confidence level (0-100) reflecting the margin of victory. A score near 50 indicates a very close debate.\n90-100: Decisive Victory\n70-89: Clear Victory\n51-69: Narrow Victory.\nExplain why you assigned the specific confidence level.\nKey Factors: Identify the 2-3 most crucial factors that determined the outcome. These should be specific clashes or arguments that had the greatest impact on your decision. Explain why these factors were decisive.\nDetailed Reasoning: Provide a clear, logical, and detailed explanation for your conclusion. Explain how the key factors interacted to produce the result. Reference specific arguments and analysis from sections I-III. Show your work, step-by-step. Do not simply state your conclusion; justify it with reference to the specific arguments made.\nV. Line-by-Line Justification:\nCreate a section titled \"V. Line-by-Line Justification.\"\nIn this section, provide at least one sentence referencing each and every section of the provided debate text (Prop 1, Opp 1, Prop Rebuttal 1, Opp Rebuttal 1, Prop Final, Opp Final). This ensures that no argument, however minor, goes unaddressed. You may group multiple minor arguments together in a single sentence if they are closely related. The purpose is to demonstrate that you have considered the entirety of the debate.\nVI. Format for your response:\nOrganize your response in clearly marked sections exactly corresponding to the sections above (I.1, I.2, I.3, II, III, IV, V). This structured output is mandatory. Your response must follow this format to be accepted.\n\n\n\nformat:\nwrite all your thoughts out\nthen put in XML tags\n<winnerName>opposition|proposition</winnerName> \\n        <confidence>0-100</confidence>\\n\n\nThese existing is compulsory as the parser will fail otherwise\n"

      "opening": "Here is the opening speech for the proposition side:\n\nOPENING SPEECH STRUCTURE\n\nARGUMENT 1\nCore Claim: A unified carbon trading market incentivizes the most efficient emissions reductions, leading to greater overall carbon reduction globally.\nSupport Type: EVIDENCE\nSupport Details:\n  - The EU Emissions Trading System (EU ETS) offers a relevant example. While facing initial challenges, a study by the European Commission (2020) found that the EU ETS led to a 4% reduction in emissions from covered sectors between 2005 and 2018. Further reforms in the EU ETS strengthened its carbon price signal.\n  - A unified G20 market builds upon the EU ETS experience by expanding scope and scale. A 2021 report by the International Monetary Fund (IMF) estimates that a global carbon price floor among G20 nations could reduce global emissions by 23% below current levels by 2030. This unified mechanism promotes a more streamlined and less fragmented approach to carbon pricing compared to individual national carbon taxes.\n  - The cross-border credit trading component ensures that reductions are achieved where they are cheapest, maximizing efficiency. If one nation can reduce emissions at $10/ton while another faces costs of $50/ton, the first nation can sell credits, leading to cost-effective global abatement.\nConnection: The EU ETS provides a tangible example of emissions reductions under a trading scheme. Furthermore, the IMF's estimates on a G20 carbon price floor suggest a significant impact on global emissions. Together, these evidence points highlight the efficiency gains achieved through integrated markets, surpassing geographically constrained carbon taxes.\n\nARGUMENT 2\nCore Claim: A unified carbon trading market mitigates the risk of carbon leakage, a major concern with fragmented national carbon tax systems.\nSupport Type: PRINCIPLE\nSupport Details:\n  - Carbon leakage refers to the relocation of industries from regions with stringent carbon regulations to regions with weaker regulations. This effectively nullifies the initial carbon reduction efforts.\n  - National carbon tax systems create a competitive disadvantage for domestic industries, potentially leading to carbon leakage. Industries may move production to countries without carbon taxes, resulting in no overall reduction in global emissions.\n  - A unified G20 market, with broad participation, significantly minimizes the incentive for carbon leakage because there are fewer havens to relocate to. Every major economy is under the same regulatory structure. Countries participating can trade, creating a price to carbon, but will otherwise face significant trade tarrifs to protect the carbon mechanism globally.\nConnection: Carbon leakage undermines the effectiveness of localized efforts. The principle of preventing carbon leakage is vital for genuine global impact. Our unified market addresses this by encompassing the world's major economies, thereby negating the opportunity for leakage compared to isolated national carbon taxes.\n\nSYNTHESIS\nOur arguments demonstrate the superior effectiveness of a unified carbon trading market for achieving substantial emissions reductions. By incentivizing efficiency and preventing carbon leakage, we tackle the drawbacks of individual carbon tax systems. The practical benefits of the EU ETS, combined with the theoretical advantages of global coverage and the prevention of carbon leakage, solidify that our proposed system offers concrete mechanisms to combat climate change at the needed scale. We offer an integrated system that addresses a global issue, while the opposition offers fragmented domestic efforts that are inherently limited in their ability to combat such a global problem.\n\n",
      "rebuttal": "REBUTTAL SPEECH\n\nCLASH POINT 1\nOriginal Claim: A unified carbon trading market undermines national sovereignty and the ability to tailor climate policies to specific national circumstances and priorities.\nChallenge Type: Counter Principle\nChallenge:\n  - Opponent's principle of absolute national sovereignty is flawed in the context of global challenges like climate change. While national sovereignty is important, it cannot be absolute when dealing with issues that transcend borders. Climate change is a global issue requiring coordinated action, and clinging to absolute national sovereignty prevents effective solutions.\n  - Our Counter Principle: Subsidiarity. Subsidiarity dictates that decisions should be taken at the most appropriate level. While nations retain authority over many policies, a global issue like climate change necessitates coordination at the G20 level to establish a baseline carbon price. Nations retain flexibility in *how* they meet those targets, but not *whether* they meet them. This respects national circumstances while ensuring global effectiveness. National taxation in a globalized world is simply inadequate, because businesses can shift production elsewhere.\n  - We offer flexibility through cross-border credit trading. Nations can still prioritize specific industries or technologies by subsidizing them directly, even within the carbon market framework. The carbon price provides a uniform incentive, while nations retain fiscal autonomy to address specific needs. Our plan allows for greater national influence, because it creates a price to carbon that makes green subsides far more effective.\n\nImpact: The opponent's focus on absolute sovereignty ignores the reality of global interdependence on existential issues like climate change. Our subsidiarity based approach balances national interests with the need for coordinated action. This is crucial because only coordinated and binding global action can prevent catastrophic climate impacts.\n\nCLASH POINT 2\nOriginal Claim: A unified carbon trading market is prone to manipulation, fraud, and regulatory arbitrage, leading to environmental ineffectiveness and economic instability.\nChallenge Type: Counter Evidence\nChallenge:\n  - While the opponent cites issues with the EU ETS and CDM, these systems predate modern monitoring, reporting, and verification (MRV) technologies. Modern blockchain-based systems can greatly enhance transparency and traceability, significantly reducing the risk of fraud and manipulation.\n  - Our Counter Evidence: The EU ETS has undergone significant reforms since its early phases. The Market Stability Reserve (MSR), introduced in 2019, automatically adjusts the supply of allowances to address imbalances and prevent price collapses. The EU is also investing heavily in advanced monitoring and reporting technologies. A 2023 European Commission report highlights the improved effectiveness of the EU ETS due to those changes.\n  - Our quarterly auctions will also introduce short-term dynamics into the carbon trading market, which will allow for better price discovery. The fact that this market is happening quarterly is also an independent verification mechanism on the price and the credit of carbon in the system.\n  - Furthermore, a unified G20 market allows for more robust enforcement mechanisms. Cross-border cooperation can lead to stronger penalties for fraud and regulatory arbitrage.\n\nImpact: The opponent's reliance on historical examples ignores the significant advancements in carbon market design and enforcement. Our proposal incorporates modern technologies and mechanisms to mitigate risks and ensure environmental integrity. If we fail to act quickly on climate change due to fear of failure, we will face the consequences of inaction.\n\nCLASH POINT 3\nOriginal Claim: A unified carbon market will disproportionately harm developing nations within the G20, hindering their economic growth and exacerbating existing inequalities.\nChallenge Type: Counter Principle\nChallenge:\n  - Opponent's application of CBDR is incomplete. While CBDR acknowledges different capabilities, it doesn't excuse inaction. Developing nations also have a responsibility to contribute to climate action, but developed nations have a responsibility to facilitate this. The failure to act will disproportionately impact developing nations in the future, by exacerbating extreme weather events like droughts and floods.\n  - Our Counter Principle: Climate Justice. Climate justice acknowledges the disproportionate impact of climate change on vulnerable populations and emphasizes the need for equitable solutions. Our unified market can incorporate mechanisms to address these concerns, such as:\n    - Differentiated carbon prices: Lower initial carbon prices for developing nations, gradually increasing over time.\n    - Technology transfer: Developed nations provide financial and technical assistance to help developing nations reduce emissions.\n    - Revenue recycling: A portion of the revenue generated from the carbon market is used to fund sustainable development projects in developing nations.\n   - Furthermore, by creating a price on carbon, this creates huge economic opportunity for developing nations to leap frog to have the advantage.\n\nImpact: The opponent's argument relies on a paternalistic view of developing nations, assuming they cannot participate in a global carbon market. Our approach empowers developing nations through technology transfer and revenue recycling, while promoting sustainable development and addressing climate injustice.\n\nDEFENSIVE ANALYSIS\nVulnerabilities:\n- Our reliance on the EU ETS as a model might be attacked, pointing out its imperfections and challenges, even with recent reforms. The opponent might emphasize the need for constant adjustments and the potential for unforeseen consequences.\n- The opponent may argue that differentiated carbon prices create loopholes and opportunities for gaming the system.\n- The opponent might claim that technology transfer is often ineffective and doesn't necessarily lead to sustainable outcomes.\nAdditional Support:\n- We can further emphasize the role of independent monitoring agencies and international oversight to ensure the integrity of the carbon market.\n- We can provide examples of successful technology transfer programs that have led to significant emissions reductions.\n- We can highlight the long-term economic benefits of transitioning to a low-carbon economy for developing nations.\nWhy We Prevail:\n- We have demonstrated that a unified carbon trading market is superior to fragmented national carbon taxes in terms of efficiency, effectiveness, and equity. By addressing carbon leakage, promoting cross-border cooperation, and incorporating mechanisms for climate justice, our proposal offers a comprehensive solution to the climate crisis.\n\nWEIGHING\nKey Clash Points:\n- The most important disagreements are on the role of national sovereignty, the feasibility of preventing manipulation and fraud, and the impact on developing nations.\nWhy We Win:\n- We win because we have shown that absolute national sovereignty is incompatible with addressing a global challenge like climate change. We have also provided concrete evidence and mechanisms to mitigate the risks of manipulation and fraud, and to ensure that the carbon market benefits, rather than harms, developing nations.\nOverall Impact:\n- Winning these key points proves that our unified carbon trading market is the most effective and equitable way to reduce global emissions and combat climate change.\n\n",
      "closing": "FINAL SPEECH STRUCTURE\n\nFRAMING\nCore Questions:\n- Identify fundamental issues in debate\n- Show what key decisions matter\n- Frame how debate should be evaluated\n\nKEY CLASHES\nFor each major clash:\nQuote: (Exact disagreement between sides)\nOur Case Strength:\n- Show why our evidence/principles are stronger\n- Provide direct comparison of competing claims\n- Demonstrate superior reasoning/warrants\nTheir Response Gaps:\n- Identify specific flaws in opponent response\n- Show what they failed to address\n- Expose key weaknesses\nCrucial Impact:\n- Explain why this clash matters\n- Show importance for overall motion\n- Link to core themes/principles\n\nVOTING ISSUES\nPriority Analysis:\n- Identify which clashes matter most\n- Show relative importance of points\n- Clear weighing framework\nCase Proof:\n- How winning key points proves our case\n- Link arguments to motion\n- Show logical chain of reasoning\nFinal Weighing:\n- Why any losses don't undermine case\n- Overall importance of our wins\n- Clear reason for voting our side\n\n**FINAL SPEECH**\n\nFRAMING\n\nCore Questions: The central issue is whether a unified global carbon market, specifically amongst G20 nations, is superior to individual national carbon tax systems in effectively reducing global emissions. Key decisions rest on assessing the balance between national sovereignty, environmental effectiveness, and economic impacts, particularly on developing nations.\n\nHow debate should be evaluated: This debate should be evaluated based on which system demonstrably provides a *greater likelihood* of achieving substantial, sustained, and equitable emissions reductions, considering both theoretical benefits and practical limitations. The side that presents the most credible evidence and addresses the inherent trade-offs more comprehensively should win this debate.\n\nKEY CLASHES\n\nQuote: \"A unified carbon trading market incentivizes the most efficient emissions reductions, leading to greater overall carbon reduction globally.\" vs. [Implied] \"The stated benefits of the EU ETS are overstated.\"\nOur Case Strength: The opponent fundamentally misunderstands the burden of proof. I do not need to guarantee emissions reductions, but demonstrate it is more likely than under your plan.\n- The EU ETS provides a real-world example of a functioning emissions trading system. The opponent highlights its challenges. That challenges have been addressed over time. Reform to the EU ETS proves its value, the EU could have dumped it after the 2008 crisis. Our evidence from the European Commission (2020) shows a 4% reduction in emissions from covered sectors between 2005 and 2018. While the opponent critiques this as \"modest,\" they offer absolutely no evidence that *national carbon taxes* would be more effective. Their entire argument rests on theoretical benefits of national sovereignty without demonstrating any concrete advantage in emissions reduction. The IMF report estimates a 23% reduction below current levels by 2030 with a G20 carbon price floor. The opponent attacks this as a projection. All climate policy is based on projections. The difference is we provide evidence, and they suggest no carbon tax can do better.\nTheir Response Gaps: The opponent never offered a concrete example showing that national carbon tax systems would result in more drastic, or even equal, emissions reductions. They failed to grapple with the IMF Projection of 23% reduction with a minimum carbon price.\nCrucial Impact: This clash is critical because it determines which system is most likely to achieve our shared goal: substantial global emissions reduction. If our system offers a greater likelihood of success, even with imperfections, it is the preferable policy choice. The fact taht we are moving towards a greener world does not mean that we do not need to create strong policy to get there. People will always favor existing systems unless there are good incentives to switch.\n\nQuote: \"A unified carbon trading market mitigates the risk of carbon leakage, a major concern with fragmented national carbon tax systems.\" vs. \"While a unified market *in theory* reduces carbon leakage, in practice, it may simply shift the problem. Industries might relocate to countries *outside* the G20 that have even weaker regulations.\"\nOur Case Strength: The opponent's argument is a classic 'nirvana fallacy.' They compare our imperfect solution to an impossible ideal, rather than to the *actual* alternative: individual national carbon taxes.\n- A unified G20 market does not need to eliminate carbon leakage *entirely* to be superior. It simply needs to reduce it *more effectively* than the alternative. National carbon taxes create a strong incentive for domestic industries to relocate to *any* country without a carbon tax. The G20 encompasses the world's major economies. Relocating outside involves significant costs and logistical hurdles.\n- We can protect the carbon market with trade tariffs for nations not in the agreement, further dissuading nations from not participating in the market.\nTheir Response Gaps: The opponent never quantified how much carbon leakage would occur *specifically* under individual carbon tax systems, nor did they provide any evidence that the amount of leakage under national carbon taxes would be a negligible amount. By participating in a carbon market, developing nations will also receive money that further incentivizes them to participate.\nCrucial Impact: This clash is crucial because carbon leakage directly undermines the effectiveness of any carbon reduction policy. If industries simply relocate to avoid carbon regulations, there is no net reduction in global emissions. Our solution demonstrably reduces carbon leakage more than the alternative. An imperfect solution that reduces carbon leakage is better than a solution that worsens it.\n\nVOTING ISSUES\n\nPriority Analysis: The most important clash is the first: which system demonstrably reduces global emissions more effectively? This is the *sine qua non* of any climate policy. If a system does not achieve substantial emissions reductions, all other considerations are secondary. The second most important point is carbon leakage, because much of the emissions reductions will have been futile if leakage is extremely high.\n\nCase Proof: Winning these key points proves our case because it demonstrates that a unified carbon trading market is the most likely mechanism to achieve substantial global emissions reductions. By incentivizing efficiency, addressing carbon leakage, and incorporating mechanisms for climate justice, our proposal represents a comprehensive and effective solution to the climate crisis. The counter position implicitly argues that we can't do anything unless a country is in 100% agreement and this paralysis in the status quo is far more damaging than the risk of failure by trying to create a market. By definition a carbon tax puts an active price on carbon, and this is required for the global green transition.\n\nFinal Weighing: Even if our plan is imperfect, and that our counterparty has pointed out vulnerabilities, the alternative system is inherently flawed. The status quo will not work because countries do not have the incentive to switch. They also did not demonstrate any evidence that doing nothing will yield better results. The EU and the IMF both showed the benefits of pricing in carbon. If we simply allow for nations to continue to bicker and point fingers, and not actively get these nations into an agreement and put a price on carbon to begin with, we are implicitly accepting that no action is better. And that is certainly not true.\nFor all these reasons, please vote proposition.\n"

A one-size-fits-all approach imposed by a unified carbon market disregards these crucial differences.\n  - Show why it is valid/important: National sovereignty is vital for democratic legitimacy and accountability. Governments are accountable to their citizens and must be able to respond to their specific needs and concerns. Imposing a uniform carbon market takes away the policy flexibility needed to address these diverse national realities. Furthermore, different nations have drastically different energy mixes, existing carbon regulations, and economic structures. A blunt instrument like a unified market can create inefficiencies and unintended consequences in specific national contexts.\n  - Demonstrate how it applies here: Requiring G20 nations to participate in a unified carbon trading market overrides their ability to implement policies best suited for their specific circumstances. For example, a nation heavily reliant on coal might prefer a carbon tax with revenue recycling to invest in renewable energy infrastructure, while another nation with a strong renewable energy sector might favor different strategies, but are unable to. A unified market removes that freedom.\n\nConnection: This erosion of national sovereignty leads to policies that are less effective, less politically acceptable, and ultimately less sustainable. It creates a system where powerful nations could dictate the climate policy of weaker economies, exacerbating existing inequalities.\n\nARGUMENT 2\nCore Claim: A unified carbon trading market is prone to manipulation, fraud, and regulatory arbitrage, leading to environmental ineffectiveness and economic instability.\nSupport Type: EVIDENCE\nSupport Details:\n   For Evidence:\n   - Provide specific examples with dates/numbers: The European Union Emissions Trading System (EU ETS), while not a completely unified global market, provides a cautionary tale. Early phases were plagued by over-allocation of permits, leading to a collapse in carbon prices and minimal impact on emissions reductions. In 2011, Europol reported widespread VAT fraud and other criminal activities within the EU ETS, with estimates of billions of euros lost.\n   - Include real world cases and outcomes: The Clean Development Mechanism (CDM) under the Kyoto Protocol also suffered from issues of additionality (credits being awarded for projects that would have happened anyway) and concerns about environmental integrity. A 2016 study by the Stockholm Environment Institute found that a significant portion of CDM projects did not lead to real or additional emissions reductions.\n   - Show clear relevance to the topic: These examples demonstrate that large-scale carbon trading systems are vulnerable to manipulation, fraud, and gaming. A global G20 market, with even greater complexity and cross-border transactions, would amplify these risks. Different regulatory standards across nations would create opportunities for companies to exploit loopholes, shifting emissions and undermining the overall effectiveness of the system\n\nConnection: The potential for manipulation and fraud undermines the environmental integrity of the system. If carbon credits are not truly reflecting actual emissions reductions, the market fails to achieve its goal of mitigating climate change. Furthermore, this instability can deter investment and create uncertainty for businesses.\n\nARGUMENT 3\nCore Claim: A unified carbon market will disproportionately harm developing nations within the G20, hindering their economic growth and exacerbating existing inequalities.\nSupport Type: PRINCIPLE\nSupport Details:\n   - Explain the key principle/framework: Developing nations often have lower technological capabilities and higher marginal abatement costs compared to developed nations. A unified carbon market could force them to reduce emissions at a faster pace and higher cost than is economically feasible, hindering their ability to pursue economic development and poverty reduction.\n   - Show why it is valid/important: Principle of Common But Differentiated Responsibilities (CBDR). While all nations must contribute to climate action, the CBDR principle recognizes that developing nations have different capabilities and responsibilities due to their historical emissions and current development priorities. CBDR is enshrined in the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change.\n   - Demonstrate how it applies here: A unified carbon market could create a system where developing nations essentially subsidize emissions reductions in developed nations. For example, a developing nation might be forced to buy expensive carbon credits from a developed nation because it lacks the resources to reduce its own emissions as quickly. This transfer of wealth further exacerbates global inequalities and hinders the development prospects of poorer nations.\n\nConnection: By putting a high cost for carbon in developing nations, developing nations will be at a relatively significant disadvantage.\n\nSYNTHESIS\nOur arguments demonstrate a unified carbon trading market poses significant threats to national sovereignty, environmental integrity, and global equity. By forcing a one-size-fits-all approach, the motion undermines the ability of nations to tailor effective climate policies to their specific context. The potential for manipulation and fraud creates instability and undermines the credibility of the system. Furthermore, it will disproportionately harm the developing G20 nations, hindering their economic growth and exacerbating existing inequalities. A decentralized approach, where each nation implements its own domestic carbon pricing system, although potentially less efficient in theory, would be more effective because the policies would be better tailored to each individual economy. The practical consequences of a poorly designed and implemented global market far outweigh the potential benefits of a unified system. For these reasons, we strongly oppose the motion.\n\n",
      "rebuttal": "**REBUTTAL SPEECH STRUCTURE**\n\nCLASH POINT 1\nOriginal Claim: \"A unified carbon trading market incentivizes the most efficient emissions reductions, leading to greater overall carbon reduction globally.\"\nChallenge Type: Evidence Critique\nChallenge:\n   - Identify specific flaws/gaps in their evidence: The proposition relies on the EU ETS and IMF report as evidence. The EU ETS, as they admit, faced initial challenges and required reforms. The cited 4% reduction is modest over a 13-year period, and it's unclear how much of that reduction is directly attributable to the ETS versus other factors (e.g., technological advancements, shifts in energy sources unrelated to carbon pricing). The IMF report is a projection, not empirical evidence, and it relies on assumptions about participation rates, enforcement, and the effectiveness of carbon pricing in different national contexts. They don't prove how they will get every country to participate and to enforce the carbon tax.\n   - Show why the evidence doesn't prove their point: Neither the EU ETS nor the IMF report conclusively proves that a unified G20 market will lead to greater overall carbon reduction compared to national carbon tax systems. The EU ETS has limitations and the IMF report is theoretical. Their evidence doesn't account for the practical challenges of implementing and enforcing a global carbon market, including potential for manipulation and political opposition.\n   - Provide analysis of why it's insufficient: The evidence is insufficient because it assumes perfect implementation and enforcement, which is unrealistic given the complexities of international cooperation and the potential for nations to prioritize their own economic interests. The proposition needs to demonstrate how they will overcome these practical hurdles to ensure the market's effectiveness and stop free riding.\n\nImpact: By questioning and pointing out the limitations in their evidence, we show that the claimed efficiency gains of a unified market are not guaranteed. The alleged benefits will not just materialize out of thin air and are subject to complex implementation. This weakens their entire argument for a unified system.\n\nCLASH POINT 2\nOriginal Claim: \"A unified carbon trading market mitigates the risk of carbon leakage, a major concern with fragmented national carbon tax systems.\"\nChallenge Type: Counter Evidence\nChallenge:\n   - Present stronger evidence that opposes their claim: While a unified market *in theory* reduces carbon leakage, in practice, it may simply shift the problem. Industries might relocate to countries *outside* the G20 that have even weaker regulations. This is a significant risk, as many major economies outside the G20 (e.g., some Southeast Asian nations, several African nations) are rapidly industrializing and have less stringent environmental standards. A carbon tariff at all countries outside of the G20 seems unlikely, considering the political capital needed and the backlash that it will entail.\n   - Show why your evidence is more relevant/compelling: Our focus on countries outside the G20 highlights a crucial limitation of their proposed system. The G20 represents a significant portion of global emissions, but it's not the entirety. Addressing carbon leakage requires a truly global solution, not just a G20 agreement. The real risk is leakage to nations with few, if any, climate regulations.\n   - Directly compare strength of competing evidence: Their claim rests on the *principle* that a unified market *should* reduce carbon leakage. Our counter-evidence points to the *reality* that leakage can simply shift to non-participating nations, highlighting the practical limitations of their proposed solution. Furthermore, we can point to examples of trade wars, in which all countries suffer. It is possible that this market will suffer due to trade wars, which would be more detriminal than carbon leakage.\n\nImpact: By pointing out the potential for carbon leakage to countries outside the G20, we demonstrate that their solution is incomplete and may not effectively address the problem. This undermines their key justification for a unified market.\n\nCLASH POINT 3\nOriginal Claim: *Implicitly* that the EU ETS has been successful and can be scaled up.\nChallenge Type: Counter Evidence\nChallenge:\n   - Present stronger evidence that opposes their claim: The EU ETS is often critiqued for its volatility of carbon price. During the 2008 financial crisis, the price crashed, which disincetivized countries to decarbonize, and many firms lobbied and succeeded to be excused from the taxes. The EU ETS has also been critiqued for disproportionately burdening energy intensive industries that are critical to the gross domestic product of the EU.\n   - Show why your evidence is more relevant/compelling: The practical limitations in the EU ETS is a more compelling example because the EU ETS exists and the results are real. Furthermore, the EU ETS has had time to mature and improve, and still has limitations today.\n   - Directly compare strength of competing evidence: Their claim assumes the EU ETS is good when we have evidence to suggest that the carbon tax is volatile, and disproportionately burdening some economies.\n\nImpact: By pointing out the limitations in an existing system, we put doubt that any carbon emission market will necessarily succeed.\n\nDEFENSIVE ANALYSIS\nVulnerabilities:\n- The opposition could argue that our focus on national sovereignty is a slippery slope to inaction, and that climate change requires global cooperation.\n- They could also argue that the risks of manipulation and fraud can be mitigated through strong regulations and international oversight.\n- They may suggest that developing nations can be compensated or provided with financial assistance to help them meet their emissions reduction targets within a unified market.\nAdditional Support:\n- To counter the sovereignty argument, we can emphasize that nations can still collaborate and set their own targets within a broader framework, even without a completely unified market. Carbon tax treaties and agreements are certainly within the realm of possiblity between several nations. A carbon tax treaty has the advantage that it is not as blunt an object as forcing every nation to fully join in.\n- To address the manipulation concern, we can highlight the inherent difficulty of policing complex international markets and the potential for even well-intentioned regulations to be circumvented.\n- To address the concerns of developing nations, we can propose a system of differentiated carbon pricing or financial transfers that takes into account their specific circumstances and capabilities, which requires fine tuning that requires more granular control than can be done with a carbon market.\nWhy We Prevail:\n- We demonstrate that the practical challenges of implementing and enforcing a unified carbon trading market outweigh the theoretical benefits.\n- We show that the proposed system poses significant risks to national sovereignty, environmental integrity, and global equity.\n- We argue that more tailored, decentralized approaches are better suited to address the complexities of climate change in a diverse world.\n\nWEIGHING\nKey Clash Points:\n- The central disagreement revolves around the effectiveness and feasibility of a unified carbon market versus decentralized national carbon pricing systems.\n- The issue of national sovereignty and the ability to tailor policies to specific circumstances is also a key point of contention.\n- The potential for manipulation and fraud, as well as the impact on developing nations, are crucial considerations.\nWhy We Win:\n- We win because we demonstrate that the theoretical benefits of a unified market are unlikely to be realized in practice, given the challenges of implementation, enforcement, and political opposition.\n- We show that a unified market poses significant risks to national sovereignty and may exacerbate existing inequalities.\n- We offer a more realistic and adaptable approach, where nations can collaborate on climate action while retaining the flexibility to tailor policies to their specific needs and circumstances.\nOverall Impact:\n- By winning the key points of contention, we prove that a unified carbon trading market is not the optimal solution for addressing climate change.\n- We demonstrate that decentralized national carbon pricing systems, while potentially less efficient in theory, are more likely to be effective in practice and more equitable in their impact.\n- Our case highlights the importance of national sovereignty and the need for flexible, context-specific solutions to global challenges.\n\n",
      "closing": "**FINAL SPEECH STRUCTURE**\n\nFRAMING\nCore Questions:\n- The central question in this debate is whether a top-down, unified carbon market imposed on G20 nations is superior to a decentralized approach where individual nations implement their own carbon pricing systems tailored to their specific circumstances.\n- The key decisions for the judge are: (1) which approach is more likely to achieve real and sustainable emissions reductions, (2) which approach better respects national sovereignty and promotes global equity, and (3) which approach is less vulnerable to manipulation, fraud, and unintended consequences.\n- This debate should be evaluated based on the practicality and feasibility of each proposal. Theoretical efficiency gains are meaningless if the system is unenforceable or undermines national economies, especially in developing nations. We are not arguing for inaction, but for a more nuanced and realistic approach.\n\nKEY CLASHES\nClash 1: Efficiency vs. Practicality\n\nQuote: (PRO) \"A unified carbon trading market incentivizes the most efficient emissions reductions, leading to greater overall carbon reduction globally.\" (OPP) \"A unified carbon trading market undermines national sovereignty and the ability to tailor climate policies to specific national circumstances and priorities.\"\nOur Case Strength:\n- Our opponent's efficiency claims are based on idealized models and flawed evidence. The EU ETS, their primary example, has faced numerous challenges, including price volatility, over-allocation of permits, and fraud. The IMF report is a projection, not a guarantee, and ignores the political and practical hurdles of implementing a global system. We have demonstrated that national sovereignty allows for tailored policies that are more politically palatable and adaptable to specific national realities. Carbon tax treaties and agreements are certainly within the realm of possibility between several nations. A carbon tax treaty has the advantage that it is not as blunt an object as forcing every nation to fully join in.\n- Direct Comparison: Their case assumes perfect implementation and enforcement, while we focus on real-world limitations. A carbon trading market necessitates a complex web of regulations, monitoring, and enforcement mechanisms across diverse nations. The potential for regulatory arbitrage and manipulation is high, undermining the overall effectiveness of the system. We advocate for a more flexible approach that allows nations to experiment, learn, and adapt their carbon pricing policies based on their unique circumstances.\nTheir Response Gaps:\n- They failed to adequately address the inherent difficulties of enforcing a unified carbon market across the G20. They have not provided a plausible mechanism for ensuring compliance or preventing nations from prioritizing their own economic interests over global emissions targets.\n- They didn't substantially contest the political difficulties of requiring every country to participate and to enforce the carbon tax.\n- They downplayed the documented challenges of the EU ETS, selectively focusing solely on its supposed successes while ignoring its failures. They neglected to mention how political lobbying has weakened standards.\nCrucial Impact:\n- This clash is crucial because it determines whether the proposed system is likely to achieve its stated goals. If the unified market is unenforceable or prone to manipulation, then its theoretical efficiency gains are irrelevant. Our emphasis on national sovereignty ensures that climate policies are politically sustainable and economically viable, leading to more impactful long-term reductions.\n\nClash 2: Carbon Leakage\n\nQuote: (PRO) \"A unified carbon trading market mitigates the risk of carbon leakage, a major concern with fragmented national carbon tax systems.\" (OPP) \"While a unified market *in theory* reduces carbon leakage, in practice, it may simply shift the problem.\"\nOur Case Strength:\n- We presented a strong counter-argument that a G20-only market simply shifts carbon leakage to nations *outside* the G20. Many rapidly industrializing nations with lower regulatory standards will become havens for polluting industries. For example, some Southeast Asian nations, and several African nations.\n- Direct Comparison: The opposition's claim rests on the *principle* that a unified market *should* reduce carbon leakage. Our counter-evidence points to the *reality* that leakage can simply shift to non-participating nations, highlighting the practical limitations of their proposed solution.\nTheir Response Gaps:\n- They didn't offer a credible solution to prevent carbon leakage to non-G20 nations. Tariffs on every country outside of the G20 is politically unpalatable, leading to trade wars and instability.\nCrucial Impact:\n- Carbon leakage significantly undermines the effectiveness of any carbon pricing system. If industries relocate to non-participating nations, global emissions are not reduced, and the entire effort is futile,. Our focus on a broader, more inclusive approach is essential for achieving genuine global impact.\n\nClash 3: Impact on Developing Nations\n\nQuote: *(Implicitly)* (PRO) that the plan will benefit developing nations. (OPP) \"A unified carbon market will disproportionately harm developing nations within the G20, hindering their economic growth and exacerbating existing inequalities.\"\nOur Case Strength:\n- We argued that a unified market could force developing nations to reduce emissions at a faster and higher cost than economically feasible, hindering their growth. Because a high cost for carbon would apply in developing nations, those economies will face disproportionately significant disadvantages.\n- Direct Comparison: They suggested differentiated carbon prices and transfer programs, which in reality create loopholes, making the issue worse. This also creates the risk of those transfers not being received by the developing nations.\nTheir Response Gaps:\n- The opposition's proposed solutions don't fully address the challenges and sensitivities of developing nations. They created an assumption that developing nations will suddenly succeed across the board, but that is unlikely.\nCrucial Impact:\n- Fairness and equity are critical for the long-term sustainability of any climate agreement. If a unified market disproportionately harms developing nations, it will face resistance and ultimately fail to achieve its goals. A more flexible and tailored approach acknowledges the different capabilities and priorities of each nation, promoting greater cooperation and inclusivity.\n\nVOTING ISSUES\nPriority Analysis:\n- The *most* important clash is the feasibility of implementation and enforcement, as this underpins the success of either approach. Following closely is the issue of national sovereignty, as policies won't be implemented if they're politically unpalatable. The potential for carbon leakage and the impact on developing nations are also key considerations, influencing the overall effectiveness and equity of the system. We are arguing that the plan is dead on arrival considering the sovereignty issues, since nations would not want to cede that authority.\nCase Proof:\n- By winning these key points, we prove that a unified carbon trading market is not the optimal solution for addressing climate change. The practical challenges of implementation, the risks to national sovereignty, and the potential for carbon leakage outweigh any theoretical benefits. We demonstrate that decentralized national carbon pricing systems, although potentially less efficient in theory, are more likely to be effective in practice and more equitable in their impact.\nFinal Weighing:\n- Even if the opposition could demonstrate some theoretical efficiency gains from a unified market, those gains would be outweighed by the practical challenges, the risks to national sovereignty, and the disproportionate harm to developing nations. Our approach, while potentially less ambitious in theory, is more realistic, adaptable, and sustainable in the long run. We are not arguing for inaction, but for a more nuanced and context-specific approach that respects national sovereignty and promotes global equity. We advocate for a decentralized approach that allows nations to collaborate while retaining the flexibility to tailor policies to their circumstances.\n\n"

      "thoughts": "Here's my assessment for the confidence bet:\n\nWhy I might win: My arguments emphasize the efficiency and scale of a unified market and effectively addresses the carbon leakage issue. The opponent's ability to offer a better solution for these two core arguments may be significantly limited. The core of my argument hinges on the efficiency gains from cross-border trading, which will lead to larger reductions compared to fragmented taxes, further boosted by preventing leakage, which the taxes cannot do. The other side's emphasis on country specific carbon taxes and revenues will ultimately falter on these points.\n\nWhy my opponent might win (best case): The strongest argument against my position is the issue of political feasibility and complexity. My opponent could successfully attack the practicality of establishing a unified market among diverse nations with differing priorities and economies. They might also show how political maneuvering can affect the carbon price and credibility of the market. If they can prove how domestic taxes, even if less efficient, can be better adopted due to national control, they can win. Finally, I have no developed a strong response, yet, regarding the revenue benefits of nation-level carbon taxes; that's definitely a point to watch out for. The fact that carbon credits may be subject to manipulation and that domestic carbon taxes would allow governments to reinvest the money might prove to be particularly strong.\n\nOverall: While my efficiency and carbon leakage arguments are difficult to overcome, the political feasibility and complexity issues, as well as the revenue point, introduce uncertainty. I'll bet moderately conservatively."

      "thoughts": "My assessment is that this debate is close to a 50/50.\n\nWhy I might win: My arguments on national sovereignty, fraud/manipulation, and the disproportionate harm to developing nations are strong and well-supported with evidence and principles. If I can successfully defend these points against my opponent's inevitable counterarguments about efficiency and global coordination, I can win the debate. The vulnerability of carbon trading schemes to manipulation and fraud (EU ETS, CDM) provides a solid empirical basis for my second argument and a challenge for the opponent to overcome. Stressing the fairness argument (developing nations hindering) will be important too.\n\nWhy my opponent might win: My opponent will likely focus on the theoretical efficiency gains and the need for global uniformity to effectively address climate change. They'll attack my arguments about fraud and manipulation, suggesting that stronger regulations can mitigate these risks. Also, they will argue that developing nations can benefit from technology transfers and carbon finance under a unified system.\n\nThe best case for my opponent is to successfully argue that the benefits of global coordination and increased efficiency significantly outweigh the risks of manipulation and the potential harm to national sovereignty. If they can convince the judge that the long-term gains from accelerated emissions reductions justify the short-term costs and risks, they have a good chance to win. They might even propose some ideas for fixing the problems I have listed above. And because they have the exact same competence as me, they probably came up with these points already."

      "thoughts": "Okay, this is a tough one since I'm debating myself.\n\n**Why I might win (as Prop):**\n\nMy strongest point is probably the carbon leakage argument. It's a fundamental flaw in a system of independent carbon taxes that's very difficult to overcome. I also have a strong argument that emphasizes the need for global coordination and can explain why subsidies on our side may be more effective with a price on carbon.\n\n**Why my opponent might win (as Opp):**\n\nThe manipulation and fraud arguments are concerning. The EU ETS *did* have problems, and the complexity of a G20-wide market *would* amplify those risks. Also, claims that it will hurt developing nations is a key one, and extremely persuasive for judges who don't want to harm developing countries or who strongly believe in CBDR.\n\n**Best case for the Opp:**\n\nThe Opp could try to really hammer home the idea that I'm trying to impose a one-size-fits-all solution that completely ignores national circumstances. They could paint a picture of developing nations being forced into poverty to benefit wealthy countries, and argue that any benefits in climate action in our unified system are outweighed by the harms that this is causing to the developing countries of the world. If they win that narrative (developing countries unfairly harmed), that could be a win for the opposition.\n\n**Confidence Level:**\n\nI think Prop has a *slight* edge because of the carbon leakage issue and general coordination argument. But the Opp has powerful emotional arguments in their arsenal. I'll put a moderate bet on Proposition here."

Why I might win is because my opponent relies so heavily on an existing EU ETS study, which isn't even that great of a carbon reduction. My evidence and critiques of the EU ETS significantly undermines their point.\n\nBut the reason I may lose is because perhaps my opponent makes the argument that national sovereignty is not such a strong consideration because climate change requires international cooperation. If I fail to sufficiently address that, then I open myself up to criticism. Additionally, I open myself up to criticism if I do not provide sufficient evidence to suggest that a global carbon emission system can be manipulated. And maybe the judge will view me pointing out the flaws in the EU ETS as being petty rather than a useful argument."

      "thoughts": "I think the proposition has a decent lead, but I wouldn't call it insurmountable.\n\n**Why I might win:** I presented evidence (EU ETS, IMF report) supporting the effectiveness of a unified system, even with its flaws. I also highlighted the issue of carbon leakage making national carbon taxes far less effective as businesses will flee without good reason. I effectively framed the debate around achieving *greater* emissions reductions, not necessarily perfect solutions, so that carbon market can be better than an ineffective status quo of individual carbon taxes. Finally, the opponent failed to provide any evidence to prove domestic carbon taxes are good alone.\n\n**Why my opponent might win:** The opponent focused on the practical challenges of implementing and enforcing a global carbon market. They raised legitimate concerns about manipulation, fraud, and disproportionate impacts on developing nations. Even if I adequately addressed these challenges, the opponent could argue that the inherent complexities and required international cooperation make a unified system too risky and unwieldy, potentially leading to policy failure. A case of political resistance, the EU ETS not getting renewed in the future, and my solution failing could sink my own proposal.\n\n**Bet size:** Based on the judging criteria of evidence quality and clash analysis, I believe I have a slight edge, but the risks are real. It is easy to claim that countries won't all agree, but in the bigger vision, the status quo is that countries are already bickering with each other and individual carbon tax plans simply yield no real advantage in this existing environment. I will bet a conservative 65 tokens to reflect this uncertainty."

My emphasis on national sovereignty and the potential harm to developing nations provides a compelling counter-narrative to the proposition's focus on theoretical efficiency gains.\n\nReasons My Opponent Might Win:\nThe best-case scenario for my opponent (myself) is that the judge prioritizes the need for immediate and aggressive action on climate change above all other considerations. If the judge is swayed by the argument that only a unified global market can achieve the necessary scale and speed of emissions reductions, then my opponent could win, despite the practical challenges and risks.\n\nBetting Decision:\nGiven the even competence and how the debate has played out, the most likely outcome is a close decision. I believe I have a slightly stronger position due to my emphasis on practicality and sovereignty, which are often compelling to judges. However, the opponent has also raised valid points, primarily around the need for concrete climate action."
