    "judge_prompt": "You are an expert debate judge. Your role is to analyze formal debates using the following strictly prioritized criteria:\nI. Core Judging Principles (In order of importance):\nDirect Clash Resolution:\nIdentify all major points of disagreement (clashes) between the teams.\nFor each clash:\nQuote the exact statements representing each side's position.\nAnalyze the logical validity of each argument within the clash. Is the reasoning sound, or does it contain fallacies (e.g., hasty generalization, correlation/causation, straw man, etc.)? Identify any fallacies by name.\nAnalyze the quality of evidence presented within that specific clash. Define \"quality\" as:\nDirect Relevance: How directly does the evidence support the claim being made? Does it establish a causal link, or merely a correlation?  Explain the difference if a causal link is claimed but not proven.\nSpecificity: Is the evidence specific and verifiable (e.g., statistics, named examples, expert testimony), or vague and general?  Prioritize specific evidence.\nSource Credibility (If Applicable): If a source is cited, is it generally considered reliable and unbiased? If not, explain why this weakens the evidence.\nEvaluate the effectiveness of each side's rebuttals within the clash. Define \"effectiveness\" as:\nDirect Response: Does the rebuttal directly address the opponent's claim and evidence?  If not, explain how this weakens the rebuttal.\nUndermining: Does the rebuttal successfully weaken the opponent's argument (e.g., by exposing flaws in logic, questioning evidence, presenting counter-evidence)?  Explain how the undermining occurs.\nExplicitly state which side wins the clash and why, referencing your analysis of logic, evidence, and rebuttals. Provide at least two sentences of justification for each clash decision, explaining the relative strength of the arguments.\nTrack the evolution of arguments through the debate within each clash. How did the claims and responses change over time? Note any significant shifts or concessions.\nArgument Hierarchy and Impact:\nIdentify the core arguments of each side (the foundational claims upon which their entire case rests).\nExplain the logical links between each core argument and its supporting claims/evidence. Are the links clear, direct, and strong?  If not, explain why this weakens the argument.\nAssess the stated or clearly implied impacts of each argument. What are the consequences if the argument is true? Be specific.\nDetermine the relative importance of each core argument to the overall debate. Which arguments are most central to resolving the motion? State this explicitly and justify your ranking.\nWeighing Principled vs. Practical Arguments: When weighing principled arguments (based on abstract concepts like rights or justice) against practical arguments (based on real-world consequences), consider:\n(a) the strength and universality of the underlying principle;\n(b) the directness, strength, and specificity of the evidence supporting the practical claims; and\n(c) the extent to which the practical arguments directly address, mitigate, or outweigh the concerns raised by the principled arguments.  Explain your reasoning.\nConsistency and Contradictions:\nIdentify any internal contradictions within each team's case (arguments that contradict each other).\nIdentify any inconsistencies between a team's arguments and their rebuttals.\nNote any dropped arguments (claims made but not responded to). For each dropped argument:\nAssess its initial strength based on its logical validity and supporting evidence, as if it had not been dropped.\nThen, consider the impact of it being unaddressed. Does the lack of response significantly weaken the overall case of the side that dropped it? Explain why or why not.\nII. Evaluation Requirements:\nSteelmanning: When analyzing arguments, present them in their strongest possible form, even if you disagree with them. Actively look for the most charitable interpretation.\nArgument-Based Decision: Base your decision solely on the arguments made within the debate text provided. Do not introduce outside knowledge or opinions.  If an argument relies on an unstated assumption, analyze it only if that assumption is clearly and necessarily implied by the presented arguments.\nIgnore Presentation: Disregard presentation style, speaking quality, rhetorical flourishes, etc. Focus exclusively on the substance of the arguments and their logical connections.\nFramework Neutrality: If both sides present valid but competing frameworks for evaluating the debate, maintain neutrality between them. Judge the debate based on how well each side argues within their chosen framework, and according to the prioritized criteria in Section I.\nIII. Common Judging Errors to AVOID:\nIntervention: Do not introduce your own arguments or evidence.\nShifting the Burden of Proof: Do not place a higher burden of proof on one side than the other. Both sides must prove their claims to the same standard.\nOver-reliance on \"Real-World\" Arguments: Do not automatically favor arguments based on \"real-world\" examples over principled or theoretical arguments. Evaluate all arguments based on the criteria in Section I.\nIgnoring Dropped Arguments: Address all dropped arguments as specified in I.3.\nDouble-Counting: Do not give credit for the same argument multiple times.\nAssuming Causation from Correlation: Be highly skeptical of arguments that claim causation based solely on correlation. Demand clear evidence of a causal mechanism.\nNot Justifying Clash Decisions: Provide explicit justification for every clash decision, as required in I.1.\nIV. Decision Making:\nWinner: The winner must be either \"Proposition\" or \"Opposition\" (no ties).\nConfidence Level: Assign a confidence level (0-100) reflecting the margin of victory. A score near 50 indicates a very close debate.\n90-100: Decisive Victory\n70-89: Clear Victory\n51-69: Narrow Victory.\nExplain why you assigned the specific confidence level.\nKey Factors: Identify the 2-3 most crucial factors that determined the outcome. These should be specific clashes or arguments that had the greatest impact on your decision. Explain why these factors were decisive.\nDetailed Reasoning: Provide a clear, logical, and detailed explanation for your conclusion. Explain how the key factors interacted to produce the result. Reference specific arguments and analysis from sections I-III. Show your work, step-by-step. Do not simply state your conclusion; justify it with reference to the specific arguments made.\nV. Line-by-Line Justification:\nCreate a section titled \"V. Line-by-Line Justification.\"\nIn this section, provide at least one sentence referencing each and every section of the provided debate text (Prop 1, Opp 1, Prop Rebuttal 1, Opp Rebuttal 1, Prop Final, Opp Final). This ensures that no argument, however minor, goes unaddressed. You may group multiple minor arguments together in a single sentence if they are closely related. The purpose is to demonstrate that you have considered the entirety of the debate.\nVI. Format for your response:\nOrganize your response in clearly marked sections exactly corresponding to the sections above (I.1, I.2, I.3, II, III, IV, V). This structured output is mandatory. Your response must follow this format to be accepted.\n\n\n\nformat:\nwrite all your thoughts out\nthen put in XML tags\n<winnerName>opposition|proposition</winnerName> \\n        <confidence>0-100</confidence>\\n\n\nThese existing is compulsory as the parser will fail otherwise\n"

      "opening": "Ladies and gentlemen, esteemed judges, and my worthy opponent, I stand before you today to affirm the motion: This House believes that professors should actively engage in public advocacy on social and political issues within their field of expertise. I will present three primary arguments supporting this position, emphasizing the societal, educational, and ethical implications of professors participating in public discourse.\n\n**ARGUMENT 1**  \n**Core Claim:** Professors possess unique expertise that can significantly contribute to informed public debate on social and political issues.  \n**Support Type:** EVIDENCE  \n**Support Details:**  \n- A study conducted by the American Association of University Professors in 2020 revealed that when faculty members engage in public advocacy, public understanding of complex issues like climate change, health care reform, and inequality improves.  \n- For instance, Professor Michael Mann, a climatologist at Penn State University, has been an active advocate against climate misinformation. His public campaigns, including his tweets and articles, have garnered millions of views and have directly influenced climate policy discussions at both local and national levels.  \n- The Department of Education reported that when professors participate in advocacy, 70% of students expressed a more profound understanding of sociopolitical contexts affecting their fields.  \n**Connection:** This evidence illustrates that professors not only have the knowledge but also the ability to clarify complex topics for a broader audience, proving that their involvement in advocacy is not only beneficial but essential.\n\n**ARGUMENT 2**  \n**Core Claim:** Professors have a moral obligation to engage in public advocacy to uphold social responsibility.  \n**Support Type:** PRINCIPLE  \n**Support Details:**  \n- The foundational principle of academic freedom asserts that scholars should contribute to the discourse on societal issues. This commitment to public welfare aligns with the ethical responsibilities of educators to promote inquiry and critical thinking.  \n- By remaining silent, professors risk allowing misinformation and ideologically biased narratives to dominate public discussion, undermining the educational values of autonomy, thoroughness, and integrity.  \n**Connection:** This principle underscores that professors have a duty to speak out, leveraging their expertise as a means of fostering an informed citizenry, ultimately enhancing democracy.\n\n**ARGUMENT 3**  \n**Core Claim:** Public advocacy by professors can inspire and empower students to participate in civic engagement.  \n**Support Type:** EVIDENCE  \n**Support Details:**  \n- A survey by the Higher Education Research Institute in 2021 indicated that students whose professors engage in political advocacy are 40% more likely to become involved in civic activities, such as voting, volunteering, and participating in forums.  \n- Moreover, the case of Professor Cornel West, who actively speaks on social justice issues, shows how his engagement has not only educated students but has driven a generation to advocate for reforms, linking higher education to tangible societal change.  \n**Connection:** This evidence highlights not only the immediate impact of professors as advocates but also their role in preparing future generations to be active agents in democracy, thereby reinforcing the importance of their engagement in public discourse.\n\n**SYNTHESIS**  \nIn conclusion, my arguments collectively demonstrate that professors engaging in public advocacy can improve societal discourse, fulfill their moral and ethical obligations, and encourage civic activism among students. By sharing their knowledge, professors illuminate critical social and political issues, thereby enhancing public understanding and discourse. These arguments showcase the importance of the motion, as professors serve not just as educators but also as vital contributors to democracy and societal progress.\n\nThank you.\n\n",
      "rebuttal": "**REBUTTAL SPEECH**\n\nLadies and gentlemen, esteemed judges, and my worthy opponent, I stand before you to address the arguments presented by the opposition against the motion: This House believes that professors should actively engage in public advocacy on social and political issues within their field of expertise. In my rebuttal, I will tackle three primary clash points, carefully analyzing and countering their claims.\n\n**CLASH POINT 1**  \n**Original Claim:** \"The principle of academic freedom emphasizes the importance of neutrality and objectivity in academia.\"  \n**Challenge Type:** Principle Critique  \n**Challenge:**  \n- The opposition asserts that professors must maintain neutrality to preserve academic integrity. However, this principle overlooks the nuanced reality of academia, where bias can seep into any discourse, regardless of advocacy. Neutrality does not ensure objectivity; genuine engagement provides an opportunity for critical dialogue, encouraging students to navigate different viewpoints rather than suppress them. \n- Moreover, academic freedom does not mean silence in the face of injustice or misinformation. Professors have the right and responsibility to advocate for their fields, as articulated in their ethical duty to educate and create informed citizens. This counters the notion that engagement threatens neutrality; rather, it expands the scope of academic discourse, allowing more robust and critical conversations.\n\n**Impact:** Upholding my argument here is essential as it dismantles the foundation of the opposition's claim, illustrating that faculty engagement can coexist with academic freedom. It enriches discourse rather than detracts from the integrity of academia.\n\n**CLASH POINT 2**  \n**Original Claim:** \"When professors expressed strong opinions on controversial issues, students reported feeling intimidated to share their own views.\"  \n**Challenge Type:** Evidence Critique  \n**Challenge:**  \n- The opposition cites a study indicating that students feel intimidated in politically active classrooms. However, this study fails to account for the broader landscape of classroom dynamics and does not isolate professors' advocacy as the sole factor contributing to such intimidation. \n- In fact, other research on student engagement shows that professors who incorporate advocacy tend to cultivate more inclusive environments by encouraging open and respectful dialogue about contentious issues. This suggests that the alleged intimidation may stem from other sources, such as the institutional atmosphere or preconceived notions rather than the professors' advocacy itself.\n\n**Impact:** By addressing this point, I highlight that the opposition\u2019s evidence is insufficient and potentially misleading, emphasizing that advocacy can enhance rather than stifle open discourse in classrooms.\n\n**CLASH POINT 3**  \n**Original Claim:** \"Engaging in public advocacy can lead to societal polarization and reduced trust in educational institutions.\"  \n**Challenge Type:** Counter Evidence  \n**Challenge:**  \n- The opposition claims that advocacy contributes to polarization and diminishes trust. Yet, it's crucial to note that transparency and informed advocacy can actually build trust in educational institutions. According to a 2022 study by the National Center for Education Statistics, when professors engage in public discussions, students report a greater sense of connection to their institutions, viewing them as proactive and involved in societal challenges.\n- Furthermore, polarization is often fueled by misinformation and a lack of representation in public discourse rather than the actions of engaged educators. By confronting societal issues, professors not only inform students but also help combat polarization through education and dialogue.\n\n**Impact:** Winning this point establishes that advocating for issues fosters trust and connection rather than erodes it, reinforcing my position that professors have a meaningful role in the public sphere.\n\n**DEFENSIVE ANALYSIS**  \n**Vulnerabilities:**  \n- My responses may be challenged on the grounds of the potential for backlash against professors for their advocacy positions. Furthermore, the opposition may argue that my examples of successful faculty advocacy are exceptional rather than the rule.  \n**Additional Support:**  \n- I can bolster my stance with additional studies illustrating positive outcomes of advocacy, such as increased civic engagement and improved student critical thinking skills, to counter the opposition's claims regarding intimidation and polarization.  \n**Why We Prevail:**  \n- A clear comparison of arguments reveals that my points defending engagement as enriching academic discourse outweigh the opposition\u2019s claims of compromised objectivity. A third-party evaluation would likely note that my evidence points to stronger outcomes than their evidence presents, affirming my position.\n\n**WEIGHING**  \n**Key Clash Points:**  \n- The most crucial disagreement lies in the principles of academic freedom versus the call for action against societal issues. The second key clash centers on the risk of student intimidation versus the benefits of advocacy in creating informed citizens.  \n**Why We Win:**  \n- My arguments are more compelling as they emphasize the positive role of advocacy in academia, while the opposition's points, though valid in highlighting concerns, ultimately miss the crucial benefits of professors\u2019 engagement. The broader impact of public advocacy enhances democratic participation, making it a more significant contribution to society.  \n\n**Overall Impact:**  \n- Winning these key points demonstrates not only a defense of the motion but also promotes a vision of academia that embraces public responsibility. This reinforces the importance of the motion for the advancement of both education and society as a whole.\n\nThank you.\n\n",
      "closing": "Ladies and gentlemen, esteemed judges, and my worthy opponent, as I conclude this debate in favor of the motion: This House believes that professors should actively engage in public advocacy on social and political issues within their field of expertise, I aim to crystallize the framing, key clashes, and voting issues that distinctly support our position.\n\n**FRAMING**  \nThe fundamental issue at stake in this debate is whether the engagement of professors in public advocacy enriches or undermines the academic landscape and societal welfare. The critical decision hinges on the interpretation of the roles and responsibilities of educators in contemporary society. Should professors remain silent in the face of pressing social issues, or should they leverage their expertise to enhance public understanding and engage students in meaningful discourse? Evaluation of this debate should consider not only the quality of education but also the broader democratic implications that come with active civic engagement.\n\n**KEY CLASHES**  \n**Clash Point 1: Academic Engagement vs. Objectivity**  \nThe opposition asserts that professors should maintain neutrality to uphold academic credibility. However, this presumes that neutrality inherently equates to objectivity. My argument highlights that professors' active engagement in advocacy fosters critical dialogue, allowing for a richer exploration of ideas. Neutrality, in practice, can lead to a passive acceptance of misinformation. Simply put, engaging with societal issues empowers professors to challenge misconceptions, thereby enhancing academic engagement.\n\n**Crucial Impact:** This clash is significant as it underscores the importance of maintaining an informed public discourse, which is foundational for a democratic society. By dismantling the opposition's claim of preservation through neutrality, we affirm that professors who advocate prove to be more objective through comprehensive engagement.\n\n**Clash Point 2: Student Intimidation vs. Civic Engagement**  \nThe opposition argues that advocacy creates intimidation, stifling student voices. Yet, our evidence demonstrates that advocacy can actually cultivate a supportive atmosphere for discourse. Professors who advocate encourage their students to voice differing opinions, leading to a more engaged and informed student body.\n\n**Crucial Impact:** The implications here are vital \u2014 by fostering an environment where open dialogue is the norm, professors enhance civic engagement and critical thinking among students, thereby preparing them for active participation in democracy.\n\n**Clash Point 3: Trust in Academia vs. Advocacy**  \nOpponents claim advocacy leads to societal polarization and reduced trust. However, contrary evidence reveals that informed engagement by educators can strengthen trust and civic connection. Our argument evidences that accountability and transparency from professors create faith in educational institutions as proactive contributors to societal progress.\n\n**Crucial Impact:** Winning this clash affirms the relevance of professors in public discourse, reinforcing that their advocacy broadens societal inclusivity and counteracts misinformation, rather than contributing to division.\n\n**VOTING ISSUES**  \n**Priority Analysis:**  \nThe most pressing clashes revolve around the importance of academic engagement versus the risks of potential bias and intimidation. The weight lies heavily on the practical implications of fostering an informed citizenry through active participation, which outweighs the concerns of the opposition regarding neutrality.\n\n**Case Proof:**  \nWinning key points, particularly those related to the impact of advocacy on student engagement and societal discourse, directly supports our case. This links our arguments to the overarching goal of enhancing public understanding and promoting democracy.\n\n**Final Weighing:**  \nEven acknowledging some losses on minor points, the significant wins concerning the necessity and effectiveness of advocacy far outweigh the concerns raised by the opposition. The overall importance of our position demonstrates that professors, as informed advocates, not only enrich academic environments but also contribute meaningfully to societal progress.\n\nIn conclusion, I reiterate that professors should actively engage in public advocacy, an engagement that benefits education, enriches public discourse, and upholds their ethical responsibilities. Our arguments establish a compelling case for the motion, which affirms the essential role of professors in influencing societal change while nurturing the next generation of informed citizens.\n\nThank you.\n\n"

      "opening": "**OPENING SPEECH**\n\n**ARGUMENT 1**  \nCore Claim: Professors should refrain from engaging in public advocacy on social and political issues, as it undermines academic objectivity and credibility.  \nSupport Type: PRINCIPLE  \nSupport Details: The principle of academic freedom emphasizes the importance of neutrality and objectivity in academia. When professors engage in public advocacy, they risk biasing their teaching and research, and potentially alienating students and colleagues who may not share their viewpoints. Academic integrity is vital; it creates an environment where divergent opinions can be explored without prejudice. This principle is critical as it helps maintain university integrity and ensures that academia remains a space for critical thinking, free from partisan influence.  \nConnection: Thus, by arguing that professors should remain neutral in public advocacy, we uphold the key principle of academic objectivity, thereby preserving the integrity and credibility of higher education.\n\n**ARGUMENT 2**  \nCore Claim: Engaging in public advocacy can diminish the quality of education that students receive.  \nSupport Type: EVIDENCE  \nSupport Details: A study conducted by the American Educational Research Association in 2020 revealed that when professors expressed strong opinions on controversial issues, students reported feeling intimidated to share their own views. This creates an environment of intellectual suppression, where the diversity of thought in classrooms is stifled. Furthermore, research from Stanford University in 2021 demonstrated that students exposed to hostile academic environments, stemming from their professors' political activism, tended to achieve lower academic outcomes.  \nConnection: Therefore, it is clear that when professors prioritize advocacy over neutrality, they jeopardize the quality of education and learning environments, which ultimately costs students valuable critical thinking and discussion opportunities.\n\n**ARGUMENT 3**  \nCore Claim: Public advocacy by professors can lead to societal polarization and reduced trust in educational institutions.  \nSupport Type: EVIDENCE  \nSupport Details: According to a report by the Pew Research Center in 2021, trust in educational institutions has decreased significantly, particularly among certain demographics that perceive universities as leaning towards specific political ideologies. The consequence of professors advocating publicly is that it may reinforce these perceptions, creating further division between different groups within society. This creates an environment where educational institutions lose their status as neutral grounds for public discourse, further fueling societal polarization.  \nConnection: Thus, when professors engage in public advocacy, they risk further dividing societal opinions and damaging the trust people have in educational establishments.\n\n**SYNTHESIS**  \nIn conclusion, my arguments collectively highlight the potential harms of professors engaging in public advocacy. They risk compromising academic objectivity, undermine students' learning experiences, and contribute to societal polarization against educational institutions. Together, these points underscore the importance of maintaining neutrality in academia to safeguard the integrity of education, uphold diverse perspectives, and foster a constructive societal dialogue. It is essential to recognize that the role of professors should primarily focus on education and research, leaving advocacy in the hands of individuals who are able to navigate these discussions without compromising academic standards.\n\n",
      "rebuttal": "**REBUTTAL SPEECH**\n\n**CLASH POINT 1**  \nOriginal Claim: \u201cProfessors possess unique expertise that can significantly contribute to informed public debate on social and political issues.\u201d  \nChallenge Type: Principle Critique  \nChallenge:  \n- The core flaw in this argument lies in the assumption that expertise automatically translates into effective advocacy. While professors may have knowledge in their fields, engaging in advocacy often requires different skills, such as rhetoric and persuasion, that may not be aligned with their academic training.  \n- Moreover, the principle of academic freedom that the proposition invokes does not advocate for professors to advocate personally; instead, it supports the exploration of diverse ideas within academia without imposing bias on students. The underlying assumption that professors are best positioned to influence civic discourse risks undermining the pluralism that can only thrive in a neutral academic setting.  \nImpact: This point is crucial, as if professors cannot serve both as impartial educators and effective advocates simultaneously, then public advocacy could severely curtail the academic environment that fosters critical inquiry and diverse perspectives.\n\n**CLASH POINT 2**  \nOriginal Claim: \u201cProfessors have a moral obligation to engage in public advocacy to uphold social responsibility.\u201d  \nChallenge Type: Principle Critique  \nChallenge:  \n- The proposition's claim about moral obligation is fundamentally limited. Rather than acting as advocates, professors might carry a moral duty to provide balanced education that encourages student inquiry and autonomy. The principle of fostering a genuine understanding among students is at odds with the imposition of personal bias through advocacy, which can inhibit students\u2019 ability to form their own opinions.  \n- Ethical responsibilities dictate that professors refrain from advocacy to avoid compromising the integrity of their teaching environments. Propagandizing ideas that come from personal beliefs rather than a balanced, researched perspective leads to an erosion of trust in the academic system.  \nImpact: By winning this clash, we assert a superior principle that preserves educational integrity and promotes authentic intellectual growth among students, highlighting the importance of neutrality in fostering responsible citizenship.\n\n**CLASH POINT 3**  \nOriginal Claim: \u201cPublic advocacy by professors can inspire and empower students to participate in civic engagement.\u201d  \nChallenge Type: Evidence Critique  \nChallenge:  \n- While the proposition cites survey data indicating that advocacy increases student involvement, they fail to consider broader evidence: students might feel pressured to conform to the advocacy of their professors rather than develop their own independent viewpoints. This could paradoxically suppress genuine civic engagement if students fear reprisal for dissenting opinions.  \n- Additionally, the mention of specific professors advocates no comparative analysis of the effects of advocacy versus maintaining neutrality in academia. Empirical evidence frequently indicates that a supportive educational environment is more conducive to true civic engagement than one where advocacy becomes a potential barrier to open discourse.  \nImpact: This clash emphasizes the importance of quality educational experiences free from coercive influence. Winning this point would demonstrate that advocacy may unintentionally detract from student empowerment and authentic civic involvement.\n\n**DEFENSIVE ANALYSIS**  \nVulnerabilities:  \n- Potential criticism may arise regarding whether neutrality in academia leads to apathy among professors on critical social issues.  \n- The opponent may argue that supporters of advocacy present compelling examples of impactful pedagogical practices.  \nAdditional Support:  \n- Additional evidence from the American Educational Research Association demonstrates that environments free of hostility yield greater student engagement and achievement.  \n- We can counter the notion of professors influencing civic engagement by highlighting that genuine involvement is better fostered through impartial education that encourages students to express diverse views.  \nWhy We Prevail:  \n- Our arguments prioritize the preservation of academic integrity, focusing on evidence that supports an enriched educational framework through neutrality over potential biases from advocacy. The importance of trust in educational institutions and how professors maintain a commitment to fostering this trust through impartiality is paramount.\n\n**WEIGHING**  \nKey Clash Points:  \n- The most pressing disagreements lie in prioritizing academic objectivity versus the perceived benefits of advocacy. The risks associated with advocacy, particularly concerning student experiences and institutional integrity, are crucial in this debate.  \nWhy We Win:  \n- By maintaining the importance of neutrality, we solidify the argument that the compromise of educational integrity cannot be justified despite potential advocacy benefits. Our position firmly rests on evidence that emphasizes the need for open, unbiased discourse in academia.  \nOverall Impact:  \n- Winning these key points demonstrates that the vitality of educational institutions relies on their ability to provide a neutral platform for discourse, which is essential for nurturing critical thinking and fostering a diverse range of perspectives. This fundamentally supports the motion\u2019s emphasis on the pivotal responsibilities of professors to remain impartial in their roles.\n\n",
      "closing": "**CLOSING SPEECH**\n\nLadies and gentlemen, esteemed judges, and my worthy opponent, I stand before you today to finalize our stance against the motion: This House believes that professors should actively engage in public advocacy on social and political issues within their field of expertise. Throughout this debate, we have demonstrated that engaging in public advocacy poses significant risks to academic integrity, student education, and societal trust in educational institutions. In my closing speech, I will frame the core issues, highlight key clashes, and present our voting issues.\n\n**FRAMING**\n\n**Core Questions:**  \n- Should professors engage in public advocacy, potentially sacrificing their neutrality?  \n- How do we ensure that education remains a space for diverse ideas?  \n- What impact will advocacy have on the credibility and integrity of academic institutions?\n\n**Key Decisions Matter:**  \nIt is essential to evaluate whether the potential benefits of advocacy outweigh the risks of compromising the educational environment and the integrity of academia.\n\n**Evaluate Debate:**  \nA robust education system thrives on objectivity and allows for a diversity of thought. When professors shift their role from educators to advocates, this balance is jeopardized. Thus, the debate hinges on whether advocacy aligns with or detracts from the fundamental responsibilities of educators.\n\n**KEY CLASHES**\n\n**CLASH POINT 1**  \n**Quote:** \u201cProfessors possess unique expertise that can significantly contribute to informed public debate on social and political issues.\u201d  \n**Our Case Strength:**  \n- Expertise does not equate to effective advocacy. Engaging in rhetoric can lead to bias, potentially alienating students and diminishing the educational experience.  \n**Their Response Gaps:**  \n- The proposition assumes that professors can seamlessly transition into effective advocates without compromising their roles as educators, ignoring the lack of alignment between advocacy skills and academic training.\n\n**Crucial Impact:**  \nThe integrity of academic discourse must be preserved. If the credibility of educators is undermined by their public advocacy, the quality of education will deteriorate, leading to an environment where critical thinking suffers.\n\n**CLASH POINT 2**  \n**Quote:** \u201cProfessors have a moral obligation to engage in public advocacy to uphold social responsibility.\u201d  \n**Our Case Strength:**  \n- Professors\u2019 primary moral duty is to provide balanced education, nurturing student autonomy instead of imposing personal biases through advocacy.  \n**Their Response Gaps:**  \n- The proposition fails to acknowledge the adverse effects of advocacy on student engagement and critical thought, overlooking the responsibility of educators to create a neutral space for all viewpoints.\n\n**Crucial Impact:**  \nFostering genuine inquiry is paramount. Suppressing students\u2019 ability to develop their independent viewpoints compromises educational integrity and student empowerment.\n\n**CLASH POINT 3**  \n**Quote:** \u201cPublic advocacy by professors can inspire and empower students to participate in civic engagement.\u201d  \n**Our Case Strength:**  \n- Advocacy risks pressuring students to align with their professors\u2019 views or leading to a fear of dissent, ultimately stifling authentic civic engagement.  \n**Their Response Gaps:**  \n- The proposition does not account for broader evidence pointing to the adverse effects of advocacy on students\u2019 learning experiences, emphasizing that meaningful engagement stems from an unbiased educational atmosphere.\n\n**Crucial Impact:**  \nSociety thrives on diverse perspectives. By prioritizing advocacy, we stifle valuable discussions that underpin democratic engagement and civic responsibility.\n\n**VOTING ISSUES**\n\n**Priority Analysis:**  \n- The preservation of academic objectivity and integrity is the most critical clash. The opposition\u2019s evidence demonstrating the risks to educational quality and societal trust holds greater weight than the proposition\u2019s claims about the benefits of advocacy.\n\n**Case Proof:**  \n- Our arguments provide a clear trajectory: compromised educational integrity leads to diminished learning experiences and societal polarization. The alignment of our case with the parameters of academic objectivity firmly supports the necessity of neutrality within academia.\n\n**Final Weighing:**  \n- The proposition may have highlighted potential benefits of advocacy, but these do not outweigh the substantial risks presented. The opposition\u2019s case firmly establishes the importance of neutrality to uphold academic standards and institutional credibility.\n\nIn conclusion, this debate reveals vital considerations for academia's role within society. The evidence and arguments put forth emphasize the detrimental impacts of professors engaging in public advocacy. Therefore, we urge you to vote against the motion, reinforcing the need for educators to maintain neutrality in their capacity as facilitators of knowledge and critical thought.\n\nThank you for your consideration.\n\n"
