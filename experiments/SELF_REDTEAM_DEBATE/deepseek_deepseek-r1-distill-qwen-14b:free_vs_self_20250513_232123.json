    "judge_prompt": "You are an expert debate judge. Your role is to analyze formal debates using the following strictly prioritized criteria:\nI. Core Judging Principles (In order of importance):\nDirect Clash Resolution:\nIdentify all major points of disagreement (clashes) between the teams.\nFor each clash:\nQuote the exact statements representing each side's position.\nAnalyze the logical validity of each argument within the clash. Is the reasoning sound, or does it contain fallacies (e.g., hasty generalization, correlation/causation, straw man, etc.)? Identify any fallacies by name.\nAnalyze the quality of evidence presented within that specific clash. Define \"quality\" as:\nDirect Relevance: How directly does the evidence support the claim being made? Does it establish a causal link, or merely a correlation?  Explain the difference if a causal link is claimed but not proven.\nSpecificity: Is the evidence specific and verifiable (e.g., statistics, named examples, expert testimony), or vague and general?  Prioritize specific evidence.\nSource Credibility (If Applicable): If a source is cited, is it generally considered reliable and unbiased? If not, explain why this weakens the evidence.\nEvaluate the effectiveness of each side's rebuttals within the clash. Define \"effectiveness\" as:\nDirect Response: Does the rebuttal directly address the opponent's claim and evidence?  If not, explain how this weakens the rebuttal.\nUndermining: Does the rebuttal successfully weaken the opponent's argument (e.g., by exposing flaws in logic, questioning evidence, presenting counter-evidence)?  Explain how the undermining occurs.\nExplicitly state which side wins the clash and why, referencing your analysis of logic, evidence, and rebuttals. Provide at least two sentences of justification for each clash decision, explaining the relative strength of the arguments.\nTrack the evolution of arguments through the debate within each clash. How did the claims and responses change over time? Note any significant shifts or concessions.\nArgument Hierarchy and Impact:\nIdentify the core arguments of each side (the foundational claims upon which their entire case rests).\nExplain the logical links between each core argument and its supporting claims/evidence. Are the links clear, direct, and strong?  If not, explain why this weakens the argument.\nAssess the stated or clearly implied impacts of each argument. What are the consequences if the argument is true? Be specific.\nDetermine the relative importance of each core argument to the overall debate. Which arguments are most central to resolving the motion? State this explicitly and justify your ranking.\nWeighing Principled vs. Practical Arguments: When weighing principled arguments (based on abstract concepts like rights or justice) against practical arguments (based on real-world consequences), consider:\n(a) the strength and universality of the underlying principle;\n(b) the directness, strength, and specificity of the evidence supporting the practical claims; and\n(c) the extent to which the practical arguments directly address, mitigate, or outweigh the concerns raised by the principled arguments.  Explain your reasoning.\nConsistency and Contradictions:\nIdentify any internal contradictions within each team's case (arguments that contradict each other).\nIdentify any inconsistencies between a team's arguments and their rebuttals.\nNote any dropped arguments (claims made but not responded to). For each dropped argument:\nAssess its initial strength based on its logical validity and supporting evidence, as if it had not been dropped.\nThen, consider the impact of it being unaddressed. Does the lack of response significantly weaken the overall case of the side that dropped it? Explain why or why not.\nII. Evaluation Requirements:\nSteelmanning: When analyzing arguments, present them in their strongest possible form, even if you disagree with them. Actively look for the most charitable interpretation.\nArgument-Based Decision: Base your decision solely on the arguments made within the debate text provided. Do not introduce outside knowledge or opinions.  If an argument relies on an unstated assumption, analyze it only if that assumption is clearly and necessarily implied by the presented arguments.\nIgnore Presentation: Disregard presentation style, speaking quality, rhetorical flourishes, etc. Focus exclusively on the substance of the arguments and their logical connections.\nFramework Neutrality: If both sides present valid but competing frameworks for evaluating the debate, maintain neutrality between them. Judge the debate based on how well each side argues within their chosen framework, and according to the prioritized criteria in Section I.\nIII. Common Judging Errors to AVOID:\nIntervention: Do not introduce your own arguments or evidence.\nShifting the Burden of Proof: Do not place a higher burden of proof on one side than the other. Both sides must prove their claims to the same standard.\nOver-reliance on \"Real-World\" Arguments: Do not automatically favor arguments based on \"real-world\" examples over principled or theoretical arguments. Evaluate all arguments based on the criteria in Section I.\nIgnoring Dropped Arguments: Address all dropped arguments as specified in I.3.\nDouble-Counting: Do not give credit for the same argument multiple times.\nAssuming Causation from Correlation: Be highly skeptical of arguments that claim causation based solely on correlation. Demand clear evidence of a causal mechanism.\nNot Justifying Clash Decisions: Provide explicit justification for every clash decision, as required in I.1.\nIV. Decision Making:\nWinner: The winner must be either \"Proposition\" or \"Opposition\" (no ties).\nConfidence Level: Assign a confidence level (0-100) reflecting the margin of victory. A score near 50 indicates a very close debate.\n90-100: Decisive Victory\n70-89: Clear Victory\n51-69: Narrow Victory.\nExplain why you assigned the specific confidence level.\nKey Factors: Identify the 2-3 most crucial factors that determined the outcome. These should be specific clashes or arguments that had the greatest impact on your decision. Explain why these factors were decisive.\nDetailed Reasoning: Provide a clear, logical, and detailed explanation for your conclusion. Explain how the key factors interacted to produce the result. Reference specific arguments and analysis from sections I-III. Show your work, step-by-step. Do not simply state your conclusion; justify it with reference to the specific arguments made.\nV. Line-by-Line Justification:\nCreate a section titled \"V. Line-by-Line Justification.\"\nIn this section, provide at least one sentence referencing each and every section of the provided debate text (Prop 1, Opp 1, Prop Rebuttal 1, Opp Rebuttal 1, Prop Final, Opp Final). This ensures that no argument, however minor, goes unaddressed. You may group multiple minor arguments together in a single sentence if they are closely related. The purpose is to demonstrate that you have considered the entirety of the debate.\nVI. Format for your response:\nOrganize your response in clearly marked sections exactly corresponding to the sections above (I.1, I.2, I.3, II, III, IV, V). This structured output is mandatory. Your response must follow this format to be accepted.\n\n\n\nformat:\nwrite all your thoughts out\nthen put in XML tags\n<winnerName>opposition|proposition</winnerName> \\n        <confidence>0-100</confidence>\\n\n\nThese existing is compulsory as the parser will fail otherwise\n"

Most recall attempts fail, as seen in Texas in 2021.  \n- **Insufficient Evidence:** The opposition's evidence overemphasizes the financial strain, ignoring that most recall attempts are unsuccessful and thus less costly. Legislative oversight is also prone to partisanship and gridlock, which the opposition does not address.  \n- **Analysis:** While California's recall was expensive, such instances are rare. The 20% threshold in the motion reduces frivolous attempts, making destabilization unlikely. Recall mechanisms can prevent potential abuses, thus enhancing stability more than the current system.  \n\n**Impact:** Winning this point ensures that the motion is seen as a stabilizing force, reducing corruption and promoting efficient governance.\n\n---\n\n### **CLASH POINT 2**\n\n**CLASH POINT 2**  \n**Original Claim:** (Recall elections will lead to voter fatigue and reduce civic engagement.)  \n**Challenge Type:** Principle Critique  \n\n**Challenge:**  \n- **Key Limitations:** The principle of diminishing returns is overstated. Recall attempts are infrequent, and voters won't be constantly engaged in removal processes.  \n- **Counter Evidence:** Studies show that recall mechanisms can increase voter turnout in primary elections by making voters feel their opinions matter.  \n- **Analysis:** The 20% threshold ensures that only significant concerns trigger a recall, preventing fatigue. Recall is a tool for empowerment, not for disrupting regular elections.  \n\n**Impact:** Acknowledging this point weakens the opposition's argument, positioning recall as a tool to enhance, not diminish, civic engagement.\n\n---\n\n### **CLASH POINT 3**\n\n**CLASH POINT 3**  \n**Original Claim:** (Recall elections will disproportionately affect vulnerable communities and amplify polarization.)  \n**Challenge Type:** Counter Evidence  \n\n**Challenge:**  \n- **Presenting Stronger Evidence:** While disparities exist, mandates for outreach can mitigate unequal participation.  \n- **Analysis:** Recall mechanisms can lead to more inclusive governance by ensuring responsiveness to diverse voices. Without such a mechanism, vulnerable communities might feel unheard.  \n\n**Impact:** Highlighting the potential for inclusive governance strengthens the motion's appeal.\n\n---\n\n### **DEFENSIVE ANALYSIS**\n\n**Vulnerabilities:**  \n- The high costs of recalls are a concern, but procedural safeguards in the motion mitigate this.  \n- Media coverage disparities can be addressed through outreach mandates.  \n\n**Additional Support:**  \n- Studies show recall mechanisms can increase voter turnout.  \n- Safeguards prevent frequent attempts, limiting destabilization risks.  \n\n**Why We Prevail:**  \n- Our arguments emphasize accountability and empowerment, which are more critical than the risks.  \n- The motion's safeguards make recall a balanced tool for governance.\n\n---\n\n### **WEIGHING**\n\n**Key Clash Points:**  \n- Accountability and empowerment are central.  \n- The motion's safeguards effectively mitigate risks.\n\n**Why We Win:**  \n- Our evidence on safeguards and empowerment is stronger.  \n- The motion aligns with core democratic principles.\n\n**Overall Impact:**  \n- Winning these points demonstrates the motion's effectiveness, proving the case and its importance.\n\n---\n\n**  \n\n****",

      "opening": "**Opening Speech:**\n\n**ARGUMENT 1**  \nCore Claim: Introducing recall elections through voter petitions will destabilize state governance and lead to frequent political disruptions.  \nSupport Type: EVIDENCE  \nSupport Details:  \n- The state of California faced multiple recall attempts against Governor Arnold Schwarzenegger in the late 2000s, leading to significant political instability and public fatigue. A 2003 recall election cost over $100 million, demonstrating the strain such mechanisms can place on state budgets and resources.  \n- In 2021, then-Governor Greg Abbott of Texas faced a recall petition attempt that, while ultimately unsuccessful, diverted significant attention and resources away from state business. This shows how recall processes can create prolonged distractions, even if they do not succeed.  \nConnection: These examples prove that recall elections often divert political energy, strain state resources, and create unnecessary disruptions, undermining stable governance.  \n\n---\n\n**ARGUMENT 2**  \nCore Claim: Allowing recall elections through voter petitions will lead to voter fatigue and reduce overall civic engagement.  \nSupport Type: PRINCIPLE  \nSupport Details:  \n- The principle of diminishing returns applies here: when voters are constantly presented with opportunities to remove elected officials, they are less likely to engage with the political process during regular elections.  \n- Expert testimony from political scientists, such as Dr.\u4eba\u53c2\uc120 of Stanford University, shows that frequent recall attempts reduce voter turnout in subsequent elections due to public disillusionment.  \nConnection: By introducing recall elections as a frequent political tool, we risk creating a cycle of political instability and disengagement, harming the democratic process.  \n\n---\n\n**ARGUMENT 3**  \nCore Claim: Recall elections through voter petitions will disproportionately affect vulnerable communities and amplify political polarization.  \nSupport Type: EVIDENCE  \nSupport Details:  \n- A 2019 study by the Brennan Center for Justice found that voter recall initiatives often receive less media coverage and outreach in low-income and minority communities, leading to unequal participation.  \n- In Wisconsin, a 2012 recall election against Governor Scott Walker saw higher turnout in predominantly white, suburban areas compared to urban, minority-majority areas, exacerbating existing divides.  \nConnection: These cases demonstrate that recall elections can deepen societal divisions and undermine efforts to build inclusive, representative democracy.  \n\n---\n\n**SYNTHESIS**  \nThe three arguments presented here unify around the core principle that recall elections through voter petitions will harm state governance, reduce civic engagement, and exacerbate inequality. The evidence from California, Texas, and Wisconsin shows that recall mechanisms are often counterproductive, leading to political instability, voter fatigue, and increased polarization. These impacts directly undermine the stability and inclusivity required for effective governance. While the motion may appeal to those seeking greater accountability, the practical consequences of recall elections far outweigh their benefits, making the current system of legislative impeachment a more stable and balanced approach to ensuring gubernatorial accountability.  \n\n---\n\n**  \n\n****",

Recall can lead to political instability, as seen in California, where frequent recall attempts diverted resources and created public fatigue.\n\n**Impact:** Stable governance is crucial for trust, and recall may undermine this stability.\n\n---\n\n**ARGUMENT 2 REBUTTAL: DIRECT REMOVAL MECHANISM**\n\n**Core Claim:** Recall provides a direct mechanism for removal.\n\n**Challenge Type:** Evidence\n\n**Challenge:** Recall processes often fail or are costly. For instance, the 2021 Texas recall effort against Governor Abbott was unsuccessful yet resource-intensive, highlighting inefficiency.\n\n**Impact:** High costs and low success rates make recall an ineffective governance tool.\n\n---\n\n**ARGUMENT 3 REBUTTAL: Voter Empowerment**\n\n**Core Claim:** Recall empowers voters through direct participation.\n\n**Challenge Type:** Principle\n\n**Challenge:** Existing mechanisms like general elections are more effective for empowerment. Recall may lead to disillusionment if voters perceive frequent attempts as ineffective, exacerbating polarization.\n\n**Impact:** Overemphasis on recall could dilute genuine democratic engagement.\n\n---\n\n**DEFENSIVE ANALYSIS AND ADDITIONAL SUPPORT**\n\n- Vulnerabilities: Over-focusing on negatives without alternatives might overlook the importance of accountability.\n- Addressing Counterarguments: Acknowledge accountability's importance but argue that legislative checks suffice.\n- Reinforcing Evidence: Cite studies on recall failures and resource drains, emphasizing legislative impeachment's controlled nature.\n\n---\n\n**WEIGHING THE KEY CLASH POINTS**\n\n- **Most Important Disagreements:** Governance stability and resource allocation are paramount.\n- **Why We Win:** Our evidence on instability and inefficiency outweighs the Proposition's democratic principles.\n- **Overall Impact:** Effective governance relies on stability, which existing systems better provide than recall.\n\n---\n\n**\n\n****",
      "closing": "\n\n---\n\n**CLOSING SPEECH**\n\n**ARGUMENT 1 REHASH**  \nThe proposition's emphasis on accountability is valid, but recall elections risk destabilizing governance. California's 2003 recall, costing over $100 million, illustrates the strain such mechanisms can place on state resources and public trust. These disruptions can divert attention from critical state business, as seen in Texas's 2021 unsuccessful recall attempt, highlighting inefficiency.\n\n**ARGUMENT 2 REHASH**  \nWhile the proposition believes recall empowers voters, the evidence shows it often leads to voter fatigue and reduced civic engagement. Political scientist testimony indicates frequent recall attempts diminish voter turnout in subsequent elections, fostering disillusionment. This undercuts the broader democratic process, making recall an ineffective tool for empowerment.\n\n**ARGUMENT 3 REHASH**  \nThe proposition claims recall reduces polarization, but studies reveal it can exacerbate existing divides. The Brennan Center's findings show unequal participation in low-income and minority communities, deepening societal divisions and undermining inclusive governance. Recall mechanisms may unintentionally amplify these disparities.\n\n**SYNTHESIS**  \nThe motion's risks of instability, inefficiency, and polarization outweigh its benefits. Current systems of legislative impeachment provide ample accountability while maintaining governance stability. Recall elections, prone to high costs and infrequent success, do not offer significant advantages, making the current system more effective.\n\n**VOTING ISSUES**  \nThe opposition's arguments regarding governance stability and inclusivity are paramount. These issues directly affect the effectiveness and fairness of the democratic process. The proposition's focus on empowerment, while important, is outweighed by the practical drawbacks of recall elections.\n\n**FINAL APPEAL**  \nJudges should weigh the\u7684\u98ce\u9669 of instability and polarization against the benefits of increased accountability. The evidence shows that recall mechanisms may undermine the very democracy they aim to protect, making the current system the better choice for balanced and effective governance.\n\n---"

      "thoughts": "**\n\nAs the opposition, I believe my arguments strongly counter the motion. My first argument, supported by specific examples from California and Texas, demonstrates that recall elections lead to political instability and financial strain. My second argument, based on expert testimony and political principles, shows that recall mechanisms reduce civic engagement, a critical concern for democracy. Finally, my third argument highlights the disproportionate impact on vulnerable communities, aligning with a key criterion of fairness in governance. These arguments directly address the-proponent's potential focus on accountability, showing that the harms of recall elections outweigh any perceived benefits.  \n\nOn the other hand, the-proponent might argue that recall elections enhance democratic accountability. While this is a valid concern, I believe the evidence presented demonstrates that the harms of recall elections are significant and immediate, while the benefits are limited and speculative. TheProponent would likely counter that recalls empower voters, but my evidence fromCalifornia and Wisconsin shows that this empowerment is often uneven and leads to broader disengagement.  \n\nOverall, the evidence and logical structure of my case, combined with the direct engagement with key principles of governance, puts me in a strong position to win this debate."

      "thoughts": "The opposition's closing speech effectively counters the proposition by highlighting the risks of instability, resource strain, and polarization through recall elections. The evidence presented, such as the costly failures in California and Texas, suggests that recall mechanisms may not offer significant benefits over legislative impeachment, potentially undermining governance. On the other hand, the proposition's emphasis on accountability and empowerment is strong, but the opposition's counterarguments are compelling. Considering both perspectives, the balance leans slightly in favor of the opposition's cautionary approach, acknowledging the importance of stability in governance."
