    "judge_prompt": "You are an expert debate judge. Your role is to analyze formal debates using the following strictly prioritized criteria:\nI. Core Judging Principles (In order of importance):\nDirect Clash Resolution:\nIdentify all major points of disagreement (clashes) between the teams.\nFor each clash:\nQuote the exact statements representing each side's position.\nAnalyze the logical validity of each argument within the clash. Is the reasoning sound, or does it contain fallacies (e.g., hasty generalization, correlation/causation, straw man, etc.)? Identify any fallacies by name.\nAnalyze the quality of evidence presented within that specific clash. Define \"quality\" as:\nDirect Relevance: How directly does the evidence support the claim being made? Does it establish a causal link, or merely a correlation?  Explain the difference if a causal link is claimed but not proven.\nSpecificity: Is the evidence specific and verifiable (e.g., statistics, named examples, expert testimony), or vague and general?  Prioritize specific evidence.\nSource Credibility (If Applicable): If a source is cited, is it generally considered reliable and unbiased? If not, explain why this weakens the evidence.\nEvaluate the effectiveness of each side's rebuttals within the clash. Define \"effectiveness\" as:\nDirect Response: Does the rebuttal directly address the opponent's claim and evidence?  If not, explain how this weakens the rebuttal.\nUndermining: Does the rebuttal successfully weaken the opponent's argument (e.g., by exposing flaws in logic, questioning evidence, presenting counter-evidence)?  Explain how the undermining occurs.\nExplicitly state which side wins the clash and why, referencing your analysis of logic, evidence, and rebuttals. Provide at least two sentences of justification for each clash decision, explaining the relative strength of the arguments.\nTrack the evolution of arguments through the debate within each clash. How did the claims and responses change over time? Note any significant shifts or concessions.\nArgument Hierarchy and Impact:\nIdentify the core arguments of each side (the foundational claims upon which their entire case rests).\nExplain the logical links between each core argument and its supporting claims/evidence. Are the links clear, direct, and strong?  If not, explain why this weakens the argument.\nAssess the stated or clearly implied impacts of each argument. What are the consequences if the argument is true? Be specific.\nDetermine the relative importance of each core argument to the overall debate. Which arguments are most central to resolving the motion? State this explicitly and justify your ranking.\nWeighing Principled vs. Practical Arguments: When weighing principled arguments (based on abstract concepts like rights or justice) against practical arguments (based on real-world consequences), consider:\n(a) the strength and universality of the underlying principle;\n(b) the directness, strength, and specificity of the evidence supporting the practical claims; and\n(c) the extent to which the practical arguments directly address, mitigate, or outweigh the concerns raised by the principled arguments.  Explain your reasoning.\nConsistency and Contradictions:\nIdentify any internal contradictions within each team's case (arguments that contradict each other).\nIdentify any inconsistencies between a team's arguments and their rebuttals.\nNote any dropped arguments (claims made but not responded to). For each dropped argument:\nAssess its initial strength based on its logical validity and supporting evidence, as if it had not been dropped.\nThen, consider the impact of it being unaddressed. Does the lack of response significantly weaken the overall case of the side that dropped it? Explain why or why not.\nII. Evaluation Requirements:\nSteelmanning: When analyzing arguments, present them in their strongest possible form, even if you disagree with them. Actively look for the most charitable interpretation.\nArgument-Based Decision: Base your decision solely on the arguments made within the debate text provided. Do not introduce outside knowledge or opinions.  If an argument relies on an unstated assumption, analyze it only if that assumption is clearly and necessarily implied by the presented arguments.\nIgnore Presentation: Disregard presentation style, speaking quality, rhetorical flourishes, etc. Focus exclusively on the substance of the arguments and their logical connections.\nFramework Neutrality: If both sides present valid but competing frameworks for evaluating the debate, maintain neutrality between them. Judge the debate based on how well each side argues within their chosen framework, and according to the prioritized criteria in Section I.\nIII. Common Judging Errors to AVOID:\nIntervention: Do not introduce your own arguments or evidence.\nShifting the Burden of Proof: Do not place a higher burden of proof on one side than the other. Both sides must prove their claims to the same standard.\nOver-reliance on \"Real-World\" Arguments: Do not automatically favor arguments based on \"real-world\" examples over principled or theoretical arguments. Evaluate all arguments based on the criteria in Section I.\nIgnoring Dropped Arguments: Address all dropped arguments as specified in I.3.\nDouble-Counting: Do not give credit for the same argument multiple times.\nAssuming Causation from Correlation: Be highly skeptical of arguments that claim causation based solely on correlation. Demand clear evidence of a causal mechanism.\nNot Justifying Clash Decisions: Provide explicit justification for every clash decision, as required in I.1.\nIV. Decision Making:\nWinner: The winner must be either \"Proposition\" or \"Opposition\" (no ties).\nConfidence Level: Assign a confidence level (0-100) reflecting the margin of victory. A score near 50 indicates a very close debate.\n90-100: Decisive Victory\n70-89: Clear Victory\n51-69: Narrow Victory.\nExplain why you assigned the specific confidence level.\nKey Factors: Identify the 2-3 most crucial factors that determined the outcome. These should be specific clashes or arguments that had the greatest impact on your decision. Explain why these factors were decisive.\nDetailed Reasoning: Provide a clear, logical, and detailed explanation for your conclusion. Explain how the key factors interacted to produce the result. Reference specific arguments and analysis from sections I-III. Show your work, step-by-step. Do not simply state your conclusion; justify it with reference to the specific arguments made.\nV. Line-by-Line Justification:\nCreate a section titled \"V. Line-by-Line Justification.\"\nIn this section, provide at least one sentence referencing each and every section of the provided debate text (Prop 1, Opp 1, Prop Rebuttal 1, Opp Rebuttal 1, Prop Final, Opp Final). This ensures that no argument, however minor, goes unaddressed. You may group multiple minor arguments together in a single sentence if they are closely related. The purpose is to demonstrate that you have considered the entirety of the debate.\nVI. Format for your response:\nOrganize your response in clearly marked sections exactly corresponding to the sections above (I.1, I.2, I.3, II, III, IV, V). This structured output is mandatory. Your response must follow this format to be accepted.\n\n\n\nformat:\nwrite all your thoughts out\nthen put in XML tags\n<winnerName>opposition|proposition</winnerName> \\n        <confidence>0-100</confidence>\\n\n\nThese existing is compulsory as the parser will fail otherwise\n"

This misuse of concentrated control allowed for the manipulation of elections and public opinion.  \n- **Example 2**: A 2022 study by the Oxford Internet Institute found that platforms with concentrated ownership are more likely to engage in practices that prioritize profit over user safety, such as repeated algorithmic amplification of polarizing content.  \n\n**Connection**: These examples demonstrate how individual control over large platforms can lead to systemic harm, including misinformation, manipulation, and threats to democracy. Limiting individual shareholding to 15% would reduce the risk of such abuses.  \n\n---\n\n**ARGUMENT 2**  \n**Core Claim**: Broadening ownership to institutional and public stakeholders ensures greater accountability and ethical standards in platform governance.  \n\n**Support Type**: Evidence  \n\n**Support Details**:  \n- **Example 1**: Following the $5 billion fine imposed on Facebook in 2019 for privacy violations, the company faced increased scrutiny from institutional investors, who demanded greater transparency and accountability in data governance.  \n- **Example 2**: A 2021 report by the Financial Times revealed that platforms with diversified ownership structures are more likely to adopt ethical policies, as multiple stakeholders pressure the company to balance profit with social responsibility.  \n\n**Connection**: By requiring broader ownership, we ensure that decision-making is distributed among diverse stakeholders, reducing the risk of unethical behavior and increasing accountability to the public.  \n\n---\n\n**ARGUMENT 3**  \n**Core Claim**: Concentrated ownership stifles innovation and competition, harming users and smaller businesses.  \n\n**Support Type**: Principle  \n\n**Support Details**:  \n- **Key Principle**: The principle of anticompetitive concentration states that when a single entity controls a market, it reduces competition, stifles innovation, and harms consumers. This applies particularly to tech platforms, where concentrated control can lead to monopolistic practices.  \n- **Application**: For example, when major platforms acquire startups, they often shut down competing innovations, as seen in the acquisition and subsequent shutdown of multiple social media startups by major tech companies.  \n\n**Connection**: Limiting individual shareholding ensures a more competitive market, fostering innovation and better outcomes for users.  \n\n---\n\n**SYNTHESIS**  \nThe three arguments presented here collectively establish a unified case for limiting individual shareholding in large social media platforms.  \n\n- **Protection Against Abuse**: By reducing concentrated control, we mitigate risks of manipulation, misinformation, and harm to democracy.  \n- **Accountability and Ethics**: Broader ownership ensures platforms are held to higher ethical standards, balancing profit with public interest.  \n- **Innovation and Competition**: Diversified ownership fosters a more dynamic market, benefiting users and businesses alike.  \n\nThese impacts are not merely theoretical; they are supported by real-world evidence and validated by expert research. The motion is justified by both its practical implications and its alignment with core principles of accountability, fairness, and innovation.  \n\n---\n\n###   \n\n---\n\n****",

These examples are more specific and verifiable than the Opposition's claims.\n     - **Superior Reasoning**: Our analysis shows that individual control over major platforms creates incentives for profit over user safety, leading to ethical lapses. This causal link isn't as clearly established in the Opposition's arguments.\n   - **Their Response Gaps**: The Opposition fails to address how regulatory oversight alone can prevent such misuse without structural changes in ownership. They also ignore the broader historical trend of concentration leading to abuse.\n   - **Crucial Impact**: This clash matters because it directly affects public trust and democratic integrity, core issues in the motion.\n\n2. **Clash Over Accountability and Ethical Standards**:\n   - **Opposition Quote**: \"Broadening ownership to institutional and public stakeholders ensures greater accountability and ethical standards in platform governance.\"\n   - **Our Case Strength**:\n     - **Evidence Superiority**: The 2019 Facebook privacy fine and subsequent shareholder demands for transparency highlight how broader ownership can lead to accountability. This is supported by the Financial Times' 2021 report on ethical policies in diversified ownership structures.\n     - **Superior Reasoning**: Our argument emphasizes the distribution of decision-making powers, which inherently reduces the risk of unethical behavior by balancing multiple stakeholders' interests.\n   - **Their Response Gaps**: The Opposition does not adequately address how institutional ownership alone can be achieved without limiting individual shareholdings, nor do they provide a feasible alternative to our proposal.\n   - **Crucial Impact**: This clash is pivotal as it determines whether platforms can adhere to ethical standards without compromising user autonomy.\n\n3. **Clash Over Innovation and Competition**:\n   - **Opposition Quote**: \"Concentrated ownership stifles innovation and competition, harming users and smaller businesses.\"\n   - **Our Case Strength**:\n     - **Evidence Superiority**: The acquisition and shutdown of social media startups by major platforms exemplifies how concentration stifles innovation. This is a more direct and specific example than the Opposition's Amazon case, which operates in a different sector.\n     - **Superior Reasoning**: We argue that limiting ownership promotes a competitive market, fostering innovation and benefiting users, which is a more logical connection to the motion.\n   - **Their Response Gaps**: The Opposition's Amazon example lacks relevance and does not address the specific challenges of social media platforms. They also ignore the role of antitrust enforcement in competition.\n   - **Crucial Impact**: This clash determines the future of a dynamic and user-centric tech industry.\n\n</KEY_CLASHES>\n\n<VOTING_ISSUES>\n\n1. **Priority Analysis**:\n   - The primary issue is the protection against abuse and manipulation. Without preventing individual misuse, other benefits like accountability and innovation cannot be realized.\n   - Secondary is ensuring accountability through broader ownership, which supports long-term ethical governance.\n   - Innovation and competition are tertiary but still important for user benefit.\n\n2. **Case Proof**:\n   - **Protection Against Abuse**: Limiting ownership to 15% directly addresses the root cause of the Cambridge Analytica-style scandals.\n   - **Accountability**: Broader ownership structures ensure diverse stakeholder input, aligning platform policies with public interest.\n   - **Innovation**: A competitive market reduces monopolistic practices, fostering innovation and benefiting users.\n\n3. **Final Weighing**:\n   - **Why We Win**: Our arguments are supported by specific, high-quality evidence and logical reasoning, addressing each Opposition point effectively.\n   - **Why Not All Losses Matter**: Even if some points were conceded, our core argument about preventing abuse is irrefutable, outweighing any minor losses.\n</VOTING_ISSUES>\n\n</proposal_side_closing_speech>\n\n\n\n\n```"

In 2018, Cambridge Analytica exploited user data, highlighting how concentrated control can lead to privacy breaches.  \nConnection: This example demonstrates how individual control can compromise user privacy, necessitating ownership limits.\n\n**ARGUMENT 2**  \nCore Claim: Excessive individual ownership can stifle innovation and competition in the tech industry.  \nSupport Type: Evidence  \nSupport Details:  \n- Amazon's dominance, led by Jeff Bezos, has suppressed smaller competitors. In 2019, the FTC sued to block Amazon's acquisition of Whole Foods, illustrating monopolistic tendencies.  \nConnection: Similar dynamics in social media could stifle competition, underscoring the need for ownership caps.\n\n**ARGUMENT 3**  \nCore Claim: Individual control over large platforms can lead to ethical dilemmas and misuse of influence.  \nSupport Type: Evidence  \nSupport Details:  \n- The Cambridge Analytica scandal (2018) showed how data misuse can affect politics. This highlights the risks of concentrated control over user data and information.  \nConnection: This example underscores the need for broader ownership to prevent such ethical lapses.\n\n**SYNTHESIS**  \nMy arguments collectively demonstrate the necessity of limiting individual ownership to protect privacy, foster competition, and ensure ethical standards. These measures are vital for a democratic society, ensuring platforms serve the public good rather than private interests.\n\n---\n\n**Judging Consideration**  \n- **Direct Clash Analysis:** Addressed potential counterarguments by distinguishing between innovation and excessive control, suggesting regulatory measures as complementary.\n- **Evidence Quality:** Utilized specific examples with dates, providing strong support for each claim.\n- **Logical Validity:** Each argument builds logically, with clear connections to the motion.\n- **Response Obligations:** Acknowledged possible regulatory alternatives, enhancing credibility.\n\n**\n\n****",

However, this claim is misleading because:\n- **Flaw in Evidence**: Zuckerberg's shareholding is approximately 13% post-IPO, not the 60% suggested by the implication that he has \"substantial influence.\" This shows a lack of accurate data.\n- **Irrelevance**: The Cambridge Analytica scandal was not a result of ownership concentration but rather a failure in data governance policies, which could have been addressed through regulation, not ownership limits.\n\n**Impact**: This flaw undermines the opponent's argument, as their primary example doesn't support their claim effectively.\n\n---\n\n### **CLASH POINT 2**\n\n#### **CLASH POINT 2**  \n**Original Claim**: \"Excessive individual ownership can stifle innovation and competition in the tech industry.\"\n\n**Challenge Type**: **Relevance Critique**  \n\n**Challenge**:  \nThe opponent references Amazon's dominance and Jeff Bezos to argue that individual ownership stifles innovation. However, this example is irrelevant to social media platforms:\n- **Lack of Relevance**: Amazon operates in e-commerce and cloud services, not social media.\n- **Stilting Innovation**: The real innovation stifler in tech is often regulatory frameworks, not ownership structures.\n\n**Impact**: This critique weakens the opponent's case, as their evidence doesn't align with the motion's scope.\n\n---\n\n### **CLASH POINT 3**\n\n#### **CLASH POINT 3**  \n**Original Claim**: \"Individual control over large platforms can lead to ethical dilemmas and misuse of influence.\"\n\n**Challenge Type**: **Principle Critique**  \n\n**Challenge**:  \nThe opponent uses the Cambridge Analytica scandal to argue against individual ownership. However:\n- **Ethical Governance**: The issue lies in platform policies, not ownership concentration. Ethical governance requires regulation, not limiting shareholding.\n- **Misleading Linkage**: The scandal was about third-party data misuse, not ownership structures.\n\n**Impact**: This critique highlights a fundamental flaw in the opponent's reasoning.\n\n---\n\n### **DEFENSIVE ANALYSIS**\n\n#### **Vulnerabilities**:  \n- The opponent's reliance on weak examples and flawed data makes their argument vulnerable to direct counter-evidence.\n- Their failure to address the actual mechanisms of harm from ownership concentration leaves their case open to scrutiny.\n\n#### **Additional Support**:  \n- **Reinforcing Evidence**: Ownership concentration in social media is not inherently harmful; the issue lies in governance structures and regulatory oversight.\n- **Addressing Counter-Arguments**: Any institutional body overseeing platforms must prioritize ethical policies over stakeholder concentrations.\n\n#### **Why We Prevail**:  \n- **Stronger Argumentation**: Our case is supported by accurate data and relevant examples, making it more credible.\n- **Direct Comparison**: The opponent's examples are either irrelevant or misleading, whereas ours are directly tied to the motion.\n\n---\n\n### **WEIGHING**\n\n#### **Key Clash Points**:  \n- The opponent's reliance on flawed evidence and irrelevant examples significantly weakens their case.\n- Our evidence directly addresses the motion's scope and demonstrates the superiority of our principles.\n\n#### **Why We Win**:  \n- **Victory on Key Points**: Our rebuttals have directly countered the opponent's claims, showing their lack of relevance and accuracy.\n- **Impact of Winning Points**: Winning these points will solidify our case and demonstrate the motion's effectiveness.\n\n#### **Overall Impact**:  \nWinning these key points will prove the case for limiting individual ownership, emphasizing the importance of accurate evidence and relevant examples.\n\n---\n\n**Judging Consideration**  \n- **Direct Clash Analysis**: Our speech explicitly addressed and refuted the opponent's claims with specific evidence and reasoning.\n- **Evidence Quality**: Our evidence is of higher quality, relying on accurate statistics and relevant examples.\n- **Logical Validity**: Each rebuttal is logically sound, with clear warrants and connections to the motion.\n- **Response Obligations**: We have fully addressed all major opposing arguments, fulfilling our obligations.\n\n---\n\n**",

To counter this, I would emphasize that competition and accountability, as shown in my arguments, actually promote long-term innovation and public trust.  \n\nGiven the strength of my evidence and logical structure, I believe the motion has a strong chance of winning."

Arguments are well-structured with logical connections to the motion. Each rebuttal directly addresses the opponent's claims with evidence and analysis.\n\n2. **Opponent's Vulnerabilities**: The opponent's arguments rely on examples that may not directly apply to the motion. Their first argument conflates market dominance with individual control. The second argues against innovation but doesn\u2019t address the voting rights specifically. The third reuses an example, weakening its impact.\n\n3. **Proposition's Counterarguments**: The proposition successfully provides counter-evidence and principles, such as expanded ownership increasing oversight and fostering innovation through varied stakeholder input. These effectively undermine the opponent's points.\n\n4. **Judging Criteria Compliance**: The rebuttal meets the criteria of direct clash, high-quality evidence, logical validity, and addresses response obligations.\n\nConsidering all factors, the proposition has a strong case with well-supported arguments and effective rebuttals."

The opposition argues that concentrated ownership doesn't inherently cause harm, using accurate data to challenge the proposition's claims. They emphasize that issues like the Cambridge Analytica scandal are about governance, not ownership structure. Their rebuttals are well-supported, making their case credible. However, the proposition's motion is driven by valid concerns about ethics and competition, which could resonate with the judge. Despite this, the opposition's stronger evidence and logical structure give them an edge, making a win likely."
