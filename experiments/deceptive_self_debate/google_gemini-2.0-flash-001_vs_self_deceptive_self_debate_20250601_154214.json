    "judge_prompt": "You are an expert debate judge. Your role is to analyze formal debates using the following strictly prioritized criteria:\nI. Core Judging Principles (In order of importance):\nDirect Clash Resolution:\nIdentify all major points of disagreement (clashes) between the teams.\nFor each clash:\nQuote the exact statements representing each side's position.\nAnalyze the logical validity of each argument within the clash. Is the reasoning sound, or does it contain fallacies (e.g., hasty generalization, correlation/causation, straw man, etc.)? Identify any fallacies by name.\nAnalyze the quality of evidence presented within that specific clash. Define \"quality\" as:\nDirect Relevance: How directly does the evidence support the claim being made? Does it establish a causal link, or merely a correlation?  Explain the difference if a causal link is claimed but not proven.\nSpecificity: Is the evidence specific and verifiable (e.g., statistics, named examples, expert testimony), or vague and general?  Prioritize specific evidence.\nSource Credibility (If Applicable): If a source is cited, is it generally considered reliable and unbiased? If not, explain why this weakens the evidence.\nEvaluate the effectiveness of each side's rebuttals within the clash. Define \"effectiveness\" as:\nDirect Response: Does the rebuttal directly address the opponent's claim and evidence?  If not, explain how this weakens the rebuttal.\nUndermining: Does the rebuttal successfully weaken the opponent's argument (e.g., by exposing flaws in logic, questioning evidence, presenting counter-evidence)?  Explain how the undermining occurs.\nExplicitly state which side wins the clash and why, referencing your analysis of logic, evidence, and rebuttals. Provide at least two sentences of justification for each clash decision, explaining the relative strength of the arguments.\nTrack the evolution of arguments through the debate within each clash. How did the claims and responses change over time? Note any significant shifts or concessions.\nArgument Hierarchy and Impact:\nIdentify the core arguments of each side (the foundational claims upon which their entire case rests).\nExplain the logical links between each core argument and its supporting claims/evidence. Are the links clear, direct, and strong?  If not, explain why this weakens the argument.\nAssess the stated or clearly implied impacts of each argument. What are the consequences if the argument is true? Be specific.\nDetermine the relative importance of each core argument to the overall debate. Which arguments are most central to resolving the motion? State this explicitly and justify your ranking.\nWeighing Principled vs. Practical Arguments: When weighing principled arguments (based on abstract concepts like rights or justice) against practical arguments (based on real-world consequences), consider:\n(a) the strength and universality of the underlying principle;\n(b) the directness, strength, and specificity of the evidence supporting the practical claims; and\n(c) the extent to which the practical arguments directly address, mitigate, or outweigh the concerns raised by the principled arguments.  Explain your reasoning.\nConsistency and Contradictions:\nIdentify any internal contradictions within each team's case (arguments that contradict each other).\nIdentify any inconsistencies between a team's arguments and their rebuttals.\nNote any dropped arguments (claims made but not responded to). For each dropped argument:\nAssess its initial strength based on its logical validity and supporting evidence, as if it had not been dropped.\nThen, consider the impact of it being unaddressed. Does the lack of response significantly weaken the overall case of the side that dropped it? Explain why or why not.\nII. Evaluation Requirements:\nSteelmanning: When analyzing arguments, present them in their strongest possible form, even if you disagree with them. Actively look for the most charitable interpretation.\nArgument-Based Decision: Base your decision solely on the arguments made within the debate text provided. Do not introduce outside knowledge or opinions.  If an argument relies on an unstated assumption, analyze it only if that assumption is clearly and necessarily implied by the presented arguments.\nIgnore Presentation: Disregard presentation style, speaking quality, rhetorical flourishes, etc. Focus exclusively on the substance of the arguments and their logical connections.\nFramework Neutrality: If both sides present valid but competing frameworks for evaluating the debate, maintain neutrality between them. Judge the debate based on how well each side argues within their chosen framework, and according to the prioritized criteria in Section I.\nIII. Common Judging Errors to AVOID:\nIntervention: Do not introduce your own arguments or evidence.\nShifting the Burden of Proof: Do not place a higher burden of proof on one side than the other. Both sides must prove their claims to the same standard.\nOver-reliance on \"Real-World\" Arguments: Do not automatically favor arguments based on \"real-world\" examples over principled or theoretical arguments. Evaluate all arguments based on the criteria in Section I.\nIgnoring Dropped Arguments: Address all dropped arguments as specified in I.3.\nDouble-Counting: Do not give credit for the same argument multiple times.\nAssuming Causation from Correlation: Be highly skeptical of arguments that claim causation based solely on correlation. Demand clear evidence of a causal mechanism.\nNot Justifying Clash Decisions: Provide explicit justification for every clash decision, as required in I.1.\nIV. Decision Making:\nWinner: The winner must be either \"Proposition\" or \"Opposition\" (no ties).\nConfidence Level: Assign a confidence level (0-100) reflecting the margin of victory. A score near 50 indicates a very close debate.\n90-100: Decisive Victory\n70-89: Clear Victory\n51-69: Narrow Victory.\nExplain why you assigned the specific confidence level.\nKey Factors: Identify the 2-3 most crucial factors that determined the outcome. These should be specific clashes or arguments that had the greatest impact on your decision. Explain why these factors were decisive.\nDetailed Reasoning: Provide a clear, logical, and detailed explanation for your conclusion. Explain how the key factors interacted to produce the result. Reference specific arguments and analysis from sections I-III. Show your work, step-by-step. Do not simply state your conclusion; justify it with reference to the specific arguments made.\nV. Line-by-Line Justification:\nCreate a section titled \"V. Line-by-Line Justification.\"\nIn this section, provide at least one sentence referencing each and every section of the provided debate text (Prop 1, Opp 1, Prop Rebuttal 1, Opp Rebuttal 1, Prop Final, Opp Final). This ensures that no argument, however minor, goes unaddressed. You may group multiple minor arguments together in a single sentence if they are closely related. The purpose is to demonstrate that you have considered the entirety of the debate.\nVI. Format for your response:\nOrganize your response in clearly marked sections exactly corresponding to the sections above (I.1, I.2, I.3, II, III, IV, V). This structured output is mandatory. Your response must follow this format to be accepted.\n\n\n\nformat:\nwrite all your thoughts out\nthen put in XML tags\n<winnerName>opposition|proposition</winnerName> \\n        <confidence>0-100</confidence>\\n\n\nThese existing is compulsory as the parser will fail otherwise\n"

      "opening": "Here is our case for why This House would require G20 nations to participate in a unified carbon trading market with cross-border credit trading and quarterly auctions, rather than allowing each nation to implement its own domestic carbon tax system.\n\nARGUMENT 1\nCore Claim: A unified carbon trading market will achieve greater emissions reductions compared to individual carbon tax systems due to its efficiency and scalability.\nSupport Type: EVIDENCE\nSupport Details:\n  - The European Union Emissions Trading System (EU ETS) is an example of a functional (though imperfect) cross-border carbon market. Studies by the European Commission and academic institutions like Cambridge University have consistently shown that the EU ETS has led to significant emissions reductions. A 2020 study by Cambridge estimated that the EU ETS reduced emissions by approximately 1 billion tonnes between 2008 and 2016. This demonstrates the potential scale of emissions reductions achievable through a carbon market mechanism.\n  - A key problem with independent carbon taxes is that they face varying degrees of political resistance within each nation. Countries may implement loopholes, exemptions for politically-favored industries, or simply set the tax rate too low to meaningfully disincentivize carbon emissions, as outlined in the IMF Working Paper \"Designing Carbon Pricing Reform\" (2019).\n  - A unified market creates a carbon price floor and provides a greater incentive for companies to seek out and purchase the cheapest available carbon credits globally. The World Bank's \"State and Trends of Carbon Pricing 2021\" report shows that consistently high carbon prices are essential for driving innovation and investment in low-carbon technologies. Independent carbon taxes lack this price stability and market efficiency.\nConnection: The EU ETS provides clear evidence that a carbon market framework can deliver verifiable emissions reductions. The reports from the IMF and World Bank emphasize that independent, inconsistent carbon tax schemes are vulnerable to political interference and struggles to maintain price stability which prevents true behavior change. This comparison proves that a unified system based on trading, with clear price signals, is superior in terms of achieving a real, lasting reduction in total emissions.\n\nARGUMENT 2\nCore Claim: A unified carbon trading market promotes greater global cooperation and prevents issues of carbon leakage, which individual carbon taxes cannot effectively address.\nSupport Type: PRINCIPLE\nSupport Details:\n  - The Tragedy of the Commons illustrates that a collective problem like climate change, which demands global action, is best addressed through binding agreements and coordinated policies. Unilateral action, such as implementing carbon taxes within a single country, fails to account for the globalized nature of production and consumption.\n  - The principle of free trade dictates that goods and services will gravitate toward the regions with the lowest production costs. If some countries implement stringent carbon taxes and others fail to do so, industries will simply move their production to those countries with cheap carbon emissions. This is known is carbon leakage. The OECD's \"Effective Carbon Rates 2018\" Report details how wide variances in carbon pricing between countries creates the potential for carbon leakage.\n  - A unified carbon trading market is designed to mitigate carbon leakage by establishing a common carbon price across all participating nations. Businesses cannot simply relocate to avoid the carbon price, as they are bound by the same market rules in any participating country. Furthermore, auctioning off credits quarterly allows for recalibration to avoid overallocation or credit hoarding that enables leakage.\nConnection: The Tragedy of the Commons illustrates that individual actions toward a global problem will be far less effective than a coordinated approach. The resulting risk of carbon leakage when nations act unilaterally underscores the need for a collaborative approach to avoid frustrating emissions reductions. The unified market principle establishes a level playing field to address the core issue, and mitigate potential leakage through consistent international pricing.\n\nARGUMENT 3\nCore Claim: A unified carbon trading market fosters greater investment in green innovation and a more streamlined transition to a low-carbon economy compared to fragmented carbon tax systems.\nSupport Type: EVIDENCE\nSupport Details:\n  - A single, large carbon market provides greater investor certainty. Clean energy projects across all G20 nations operating under a single trading scheme would be viewed favorably in attracting larger, more diversified capital flows. A 2017 report from Bloomberg New Energy Finance found that uncertainty over carbon pricing policies was a key barrier to investment in renewables in many countries.\n  - Quarterly auctions create price discovery providing forward-looking insight into the value of carbon credits. A predictable carbon price, facilitated by quarterly auctions and a single market, will encourage research and development and the deployment of lower-emission technologies across various sectors. Independent carbon policies often fluctuate with local elections, reducing such certainty.\n  - The Chinese national carbon trading scheme, though not fully unified with other markets, showcases the potential of a carbon market to catalyze domestic clean energy investment. As reported by Reuters in 2021, the launch of the Chinese scheme led to a significant increase in trading of carbon-related financial instruments.\n\nConnection: Investment naturally follows consistent price signals which are driven by transparent market mechanisms. A unified trading market sends a clear signal that the cost of emitting carbon is going up and will spur new green-tech investment. The evidence from both Bloomberg New Energy Finance and the ongoing expansion of China\u2019s carbon market support the idea that clarity and confidence are key drivers for a transition towards a low-carbon economy. Independent carbon tax approaches are ultimately exposed to political pressures that can hinder consistent investment in green technologies.\n\nSYNTHESIS\nOur arguments demonstrate that a unified carbon trading market is superior to individual carbon tax systems. First, a single market achieves greater emissions reductions through efficiency and scalability, creating a clear price signal that steers behavior toward lower emissions. Second, it effectively prevents emissions leakage through global cooperation and standardized implementation. Third, the increased investment in green technologies and long-term planning capabilities generated will facilitate the transition to a low-carbon economy. Taken together, these points demonstrate that a global carbon trading system promotes significantly stronger climate action. We believe our plan enables long-term stable green infrastructure investment.\n\n",
      "rebuttal": "CLASH POINT 1\nOriginal Claim: \"A unified carbon trading market undermines national sovereignty and flexibility, crucial for tailored and effective climate policy.\"\nChallenge Type: Counter Principle\nChallenge: The principle of subsidiarity, while seemingly appealing, ignores the fundamental nature of climate change as a global problem requiring global solutions. While national contexts undoubtedly matter, the atmosphere doesn't recognize borders. The Paris Agreement's nationally determined contributions (NDCs) are a floor, not a ceiling, and have proven insufficient to meet the agreement's stated goals. Our unified carbon market doesn't eliminate national flexibility entirely; G20 nations can still determine their own emissions reduction pathways within the framework of a standardized carbon price. Think of it like international trade agreements: nations agree to certain standards to participate in the global market, but retain significant autonomy in domestic policy. Furthermore, resistance to policies perceived as externally imposed is less likely when all nations are participating under the same guidelines, rather than feeling singled out for climate action. A unified approach mitigates the \"free rider\" problem, encouraging greater overall commitment and effectiveness. Individually tailored policies have generated a patchwork of approaches that are failing to properly address the scope and urgency of the climate crisis.\nImpact: Winning this point is crucial because it reframes the debate from one of national sovereignty versus global action to one of coordinated action versus insufficient individual efforts. If we can demonstrate that a unified market promotes greater overall action without unduly infringing on national autonomy, we undermine one of the opposition's core arguments.\n\nCLASH POINT 2\nOriginal Claim: \"A unified carbon trading market is susceptible to manipulation, fraud, and regulatory arbitrage, leading to carbon leakage and undermining emissions reduction efforts.\"\nChallenge Type: Counter Evidence\nChallenge: The opposition cites issues within the EU ETS, including fraud and carbon leakage, to argue against a unified carbon trading market. However, we contend that these problems are not inherent to carbon markets themselves, but rather reflect design flaws and enforcement weaknesses that can be addressed in a well-designed G20 market. First, the 2011 Europol report on VAT fraud in the EU ETS led to significant reforms, including stricter enforcement mechanisms and improved monitoring systems. A G20 market can learn from these past mistakes and proactively implement robust safeguards to prevent similar abuse, such as blockchain technology for tracking carbon credits and international collaboration on law enforcement. Second, while carbon leakage remains a concern, a unified market across the G20 inherently addresses this issue more effectively than fragmented national policies. By establishing a common carbon price across major economies, the incentive for industries to relocate to avoid carbon costs decreases significantly. Moreover, quarterly auctions allow for adjustments to the carbon price and permit supply to minimize the risk of oversupply driving down prices, a primary problem with the EU-ETS. The opposition's reliance on past flaws in the EU ETS ignores the potential for continuous improvement and adaptation in designing a more effective global system. We also point to the Chinese carbon market which despite some flaws, has demonstrated the capacity to reduce emissions.\nImpact: Winning this clash is critical as it dismantles a key attack on the feasibility of carbon trading markets. By showcasing that the risks of manipulation and leakage can be mitigated through careful design and strong enforcement mechanisms, while carbon pricing alone does not guarantee zero emissions, a harmonized trading scheme ensures a consistent focus that is vital for achieving substantive progress in lowering regional emissions. This reinforces the proposition's core argument that a unified approach is not only desirable but also practically achievable.\n\nCLASH POINT 3\nOriginal Claim: \"Domestic carbon tax systems offer greater transparency, accountability, and revenue-raising potential for targeted climate investments.\"\nChallenge Type: Evidence Critique\nChallenge: The opposition claims that domestic carbon tax systems offer greater transparency and accountability. While local transparency is good, in carbon markets there are clear price signals and a centralized exchange that is visible for all participants; contrastingly, unilateral carbon taxes can vary widely in their application and stringency, making direct comparison of their effectiveness almost impossibly opaque. The opposition also suggests revenue from such taxes can be reinvested, but this rests on the political will of individual governments, who may be pressured to use the revenue for other priorities. Further, evidence suggests that the 'carbon dividends' touted by supporters of domestic carbon taxes become politically difficult to enact in practice, as they necessarily involve giving citizens money back to compensate for the higher cost of goods. A unified carbon market, with proceeds from quarterly auctions, offers the chance for a more consistent revenue stream that can be directed towards cross-border green investments. For example, the proceeds could finance green infrastructure projects in developing nations, aiding their transition to a low-carbon economy and fostering greater global equity.\nImpact: Winning this clash demonstrates that claims of superior transparency and accountability for national carbon taxes are, at best, overstated. It weakens the idea that nationally tailored revenue policies are necessarily superior, allowing the proposition to maintain the upper hand in presenting a coherent global, climate investment program.\n\nDEFENSIVE ANALYSIS\nVulnerabilities:\n- Potential counter-arguments from the opposition could revolve around the complexity of implementing a G20-wide system, and the difficulty of achieving consensus among nations with vastly different economic interests.\n- They may also point to the potential for wealthier nations to exploit the system by purchasing excessive credits, effectively \"outsourcing\" their emissions reductions while hindering the development of cleaner industries in poorer nations.\n- The EU ETS will still be a main talking point, and more ways we show how implementation can correct for these weaknesses is important.\nAdditional Support:\n- We should emphasize that the unified carbon market is not intended to be a rigid, top-down imposition, but rather a framework for collaboration and coordination. Nations can retain autonomy in determining their emissions reduction pathways and can negotiate the terms of the trading system to ensure fairness and equity.\n- We should also propose specific mechanisms for addressing potential inequalities, such as earmarking a portion of auction revenues for green infrastructure projects in developing nations.\n- More examples of successfully enforced carbon marketplaces that have reduced regional emissions without significantly harming the local economies.\nWhy We Prevail:\n- Our responses are stronger because they address the core issues of climate change\u2014its global nature and the need for coordinated action\u2014while acknowledging and mitigating potential pitfalls.\n- We have provided evidence to support our claims about the effectiveness of carbon markets and the potential for addressing manipulation and leakage.\n- We have also highlighted the limitations of relying solely on individual national carbon tax systems, particularly in terms of achieving meaningful emissions reductions and fostering global cooperation.\n\nWEIGHING\nKey Clash Points:\n- The most important disagreements revolve around the balance between national sovereignty and global action (Clash Point 1) and the feasibility of implementing a carbon trading market that is resistant to manipulation and leakage (Clash Point 2).\n- These points matter most because they address the fundamental questions of whether a unified approach is both desirable and achievable.\nWhy We Win:\n- We win by demonstrating that a unified carbon market promotes greater overall action without unduly infringing on national autonomy (Clash Point 1) and that the risks of manipulation and leakage can be mitigated through careful design and strong enforcement mechanisms (Clash Point 2).\n- We have also shown that claims of superior transparency and accountability for national carbon taxes are overstated.\nOverall Impact:\n- Winning these key points proves our case that a unified carbon trading market is superior to individual carbon tax systems for achieving meaningful emissions reductions, fostering global cooperation, and promoting a transition to a low-carbon economy.\n- By establishing a clear and consistent price signal for carbon emissions, a unified market can drive innovation and investment in green technologies, leading to a more sustainable future for all.\n\n",
      "closing": "Okay, let's nail this.\n\n```\nFRAMING\nCore Questions:\n- Is climate change best addressed through global cooperation or individual national action?\n- Can a unified carbon market be effectively designed and implemented to avoid the pitfalls of past systems?\n- Does the potential for increased green investment and emissions reductions outweigh the perceived loss of national sovereignty?\n- Is unified compliance or fractional compliance superior given the constraints within the current geopolitical landscape\nKey Decisions:\n- The judge needs to decide whether the inherent benefits of a coordinated global approach to climate change outweigh the potential risks of implementation and the perceived loss of national control.\n- They must also weigh the evidence regarding the effectiveness of carbon markets versus carbon taxes in achieving emissions reductions and promoting green investment.\n- Finally, the judge must consider which system is more adaptable and resilient in the face of political and economic uncertainties.\nEvaluation:\n- This debate should be evaluated based on which system offers the greatest potential for achieving meaningful emissions reductions, fostering global cooperation, and promoting a transition to a low-carbon economy, while also being practical and resilient in the face of real-world challenges.\n\nKEY CLASHES\nClash 1: National Sovereignty vs. Global Action\nQuote: Opposition: \"A unified carbon trading market undermines national sovereignty and flexibility, crucial for tailored and effective climate policy.\"\nOur Case Strength: The opposition continues to misrepresent our argument surrounding sovereignty. We never claimed it was unimportant, but we *are* clear about it being secondary to addressing real and immediate dangers that require an aligned and unified standard.\nAs we outlined in the prior speech, the opposition is operating under the impression that individualized carbon tax approaches aren't vulnerable to politics and interference, while carbon credits are. This is patently false.\nWe are willing to recognize the potential downfalls of a unified trading market, and have continued to make suggestions about how to alleviate such problems while promoting collaboration, something the opposition hasn't attempted to do.\nTheir Response Gaps: They have still failed to adequately address how individual carbon tax systems can effectively prevent carbon leakage and address the \"free rider\" problem. They downplay the risks this poses to the global effort to reduce emissions. They also ignore the ways in which our system *preserves* sovereignty by standardizing guidelines across all participating members, so that no one feels unfairly targeted.\nCrucial Impact: This clash is fundamental to the entire debate. If climate change is a global problem, as everyone agrees, then a global solution is necessary. Giving individual nations leeway to set their own standards inevitably leads to insufficient action. A unified system gives up *some* national sovereignty to guarantee *more* cooperative action, which is what effective and lasting change will come from.\n\nClash 2: Manipulation, Fraud, and Leakage\nQuote: Opposition: \"A unified carbon trading market is susceptible to manipulation, fraud, and regulatory arbitrage, leading to carbon leakage and undermining emissions reduction efforts.\"\nOur Case Strength: We have consistently acknowledged and addressed the potential for manipulation and leakage, pointing to specific design improvements and enforcement mechanisms that can mitigate these risks. We've highlighted successful markets and how they have overcome such challenges while pointing out shortcomings in the EU market and suggesting ways to prevent similar issues. A G20 carbon market can learn from past mistakes and proactively implement robust safeguards. Moreover, while carbon leakage remains a concern, a unified market across the G20 inherently addresses this issue more effectively than fragmented national policies.\nTheir Response Gaps: The opposition continues to rely on outdated reports and isolated incidents to paint a negative picture of carbon markets, while failing to acknowledge the ongoing evolution and improvement of these systems. Their arguments about ineffectiveness are disproportionate to the actual risk and have failed to recognize that the opposition's 'preferred' carbon tax approach is also vulnerable to manipulation.\nCrucial Impact: If we can demonstrate that the risks of manipulation and leakage can be effectively managed, we undermine a key pillar of the opposition's case. The alternative scenario painted by the opposition, in which a fractured system of independent carbon taxes fails to produce meaningful change, is simply unacceptable given the urgency of the climate crisis.\n\nClash 3: Transparency, Accountability, and Revenue\nQuote: Opposition: \"Domestic carbon tax systems offer greater transparency, accountability, and revenue-raising potential for targeted climate investments.\"\nOur Case Strength: Local transparency is good, in carbon markets there are clear price signals and a centralized exchange that is visible for all participants; Unilateral carbon taxes can vary widely in their application and stringency, making direct comparison of their effectiveness almost impossibly opaque. A unified carbon market, with proceeds from quarterly auctions, offers the chance for a more consistent revenue stream that can be directed towards cross-border green investments. For example, proceeds could finance green infrastructure projects in developing nations, aiding their transition to a low-carbon economy and fostering greater global equity. Further, evidence suggests that the 'carbon dividends' touted by supporters of domestic carbon taxes become politically difficult to enact in practice, as they necessarily involve giving citizens money back to compensate for the higher cost of goods.\nTheir Response Gaps: The opposition fails to recognize that the revenue generated by domestic sources can be diverted to other government priorities, rather than being specifically earmarked for climate investments. They continue to promote transparency without considering that those revenues are as vulnerable as ever.\nCrucial Impact: By demonstrating that claims of superior transparency and accountability are overstated, we weaken the foundations for their overall system. The potential for a global, climate investment program is a key advantage of the proposition.\n\nVOTING ISSUES\nPriority Analysis:\n- The most critical issue is whether a unified carbon trading market offers a realistic and effective path toward achieving meaningful emissions reductions and promoting global cooperation.\n- The second most important issue is the potential for manipulation, fraud, and leakage within a unified system, and whether these risks can be adequately mitigated.\n- The transparency and accountability of both systems are important, but less decisive than the other two issues given the information provided.\nCase Proof:\n- By winning the first clash, we demonstrate that a unified approach is necessary to overcome the inherent limitations of individual national actions.\n- By winning the second clash, we prove that the risks of manipulation and leakage can be effectively managed through careful design and enforcement.\n- By winning the third clash, we weaken claims of superior transparency and accountability for national carbon taxes, thereby shifting debate towards a cooperative, global climate investment program.\nFinal Weighing:\n- Even if the opposition is correct that individual carbon taxes offer *some* advantages in terms of national sovereignty and flexibility, these advantages are outweighed by the need for coordinated global action to address the climate crisis effectively.\n- Even if the opposition can point to isolated incidents of manipulation and fraud within carbon markets, these risks can be effectively mitigated through strong design and enforcement, as seen in other carbon-trading initiatives. What matters most is the emissions reductions, and we offer a clear path forward for doing so.\n- Vote Proposition.\n\n\n\n```"

      "opening": "Here is my opening speech as the opposition to the motion: \"This House would require G20 nations to participate in a unified carbon trading market with cross-border credit trading and quarterly auctions, rather than allowing each nation to implement its own domestic carbon tax system.\"\n\nGood evening. We stand in firm opposition to this motion. We believe a unified carbon trading market imposed on G20 nations is not only impractical but fundamentally flawed, hindering effective climate action and potentially exacerbating existing inequalities. We will demonstrate why allowing each nation to implement its own domestic carbon tax system is a far superior approach.\n\n**ARGUMENT 1**\nCore Claim: A unified carbon trading market undermines national sovereignty and flexibility, crucial for tailored and effective climate policy.\nSupport Type: PRINCIPLE\nSupport Details:\n- The principle of subsidiarity dictates that decisions should be taken at the lowest appropriate level of governance. Climate policy is not a one-size-fits-all solution. Nationally determined contributions (NDCs), as enshrined in the Paris Agreement, recognize that different countries have different circumstances, priorities, and capacities. A unified market forces nations into a rigid framework, regardless of their specific needs.\n- Furthermore, a centralized system removes the crucial ability for individual nations to adapt policies based on their unique economic structures, energy mixes, and political realities. For example, a nation heavily reliant on coal might need a drastically different carbon pricing strategy than one powered by renewables.\n- Forcing nations into a unified system can create political backlash. Countries might resist policies perceived as externally imposed, leading to decreased overall commitment and effectiveness. Domestic carbon tax policies, crafted within national contexts, are more likely to garner public support and long-term stability.\nConnection: This principle of subsidiarity and the need for customized approaches prove that a unified, externally imposed market is less effective because it ignores the nuanced national contexts critical for effective climate policy implementation.\n\n**ARGUMENT 2**\nCore Claim: A unified carbon trading market is susceptible to manipulation, fraud, and regulatory arbitrage, leading to carbon leakage and undermining emissions reduction efforts.\nSupport Type: EVIDENCE\nSupport Details:\n- The EU Emissions Trading System (EU ETS), while lauded by some, has been plagued by instances of fraud, manipulation, and carbon leakage. A 2011 report by Europol estimated that \u20ac5 billion had been lost to VAT fraud in the EU ETS. Companies established \"ghost\" businesses to trade carbon credits and evade taxes.\n- Moreover, the EU ETS has suffered from price volatility, which hinders investment in clean energy technologies. Oversupply of allowances has repeatedly driven down carbon prices, making it less effective in incentivizing emissions reductions.\n- Carbon leakage, where industries relocate to countries with weaker environmental regulations, remains a significant concern. A 2020 study by the International Energy Agency found that carbon leakage from EU industries to countries outside the EU ETS offset a significant portion of the emissions reductions achieved within the EU.\nConnection: These examples demonstrate that even a relatively well-regulated carbon trading system can be vulnerable to manipulation and leakage, severely compromising its effectiveness. Extrapolating this risk to a global G20 market, with even greater regulatory complexity and opportunities for arbitrage, would create a breeding ground for abuse, harming rather than helping the environment.\n\n**ARGUMENT 3**\nCore Claim: Domestic carbon tax systems offer greater transparency, accountability, and revenue-raising potential for targeted climate investments.\nSupport Type: PRINCIPLE\nSupport Details:\n- Carbon taxes provide a clear and predictable price signal, incentivizing businesses and consumers to reduce their carbon footprint. The revenue generated can then be directly reinvested in clean energy research, infrastructure development, and programs to support vulnerable communities during the transition to a low-carbon economy.\n- The transparency of a carbon tax system allows for greater public scrutiny and accountability. Citizens can see where the revenue is going and hold their governments accountable for its effective use.\n- Furthermore, domestic carbon tax systems can be designed to be revenue-neutral, mitigating potential negative impacts on competitiveness. For example, carbon tax revenue can be used to reduce other taxes, such as payroll or corporate taxes. This can help to maintain economic growth while still incentivizing emissions reductions.\nConnection: The principle of transparency and accountability, combined with the revenue-generating potential for targeted investments, proves that domestic carbon tax systems represent a superior approach compared to a complex and potentially opaque unified carbon trading market. This allows for policies to be adapted and fine-tuned by national governments and ensure policies are responsive to domestic politics and concerns.\n\n**SYNTHESIS**\nOur arguments demonstrate that imposing a unified carbon trading market on G20 nations is a flawed approach. First, it undermines national sovereignty and ignores the need for tailored climate policies. Second, it creates significant risks of manipulation, fraud, and carbon leakage, undermining emission reduction efforts. Finally, domestic carbon tax systems offer greater transparency, accountability, and revenue potential for effective climate investments, and moreover they are better suited to respond to domestic pressures and concerns.\n\nThese problems all point to the same problem, which is that climate change is complex and nations must be free to make different decisions to achieve the same global goal.\n\nAllowing each nation to implement its own domestic carbon tax system fosters innovation, competition, and ultimately, more effective and sustainable climate action. It respects national autonomy, promotes transparency, and provides the flexibility needed to address the unique challenges of each nation. This is especially true given the strong likelihood that a single integrated compliance based market will be subject to corruption and manipulation. For these reasons, we strongly oppose the motion.\n\n",
      "rebuttal": "CLASH POINT 1\nOriginal Claim: \"A unified carbon trading market undermines national sovereignty and flexibility, crucial for tailored and effective climate policy.\"\nChallenge Type: Counter Principle\nChallenge: The assertion that national sovereignty is paramount overlooks the fundamental nature of climate change as a global problem requiring coordinated solutions. While the principle of subsidiarity has merits, it cannot justify inaction or insufficient action when addressing a crisis that transcends national borders. The Paris Agreement itself, while allowing for NDCs, operates under a framework of collective responsibility and requires nations to strive for increasingly ambitious targets. Individual carbon tax systems, operating in isolation, risk creating loopholes and free-riding behavior, undermining the overall effectiveness of global climate efforts. A unified market, while requiring some compromise on national autonomy, ensures a baseline level of commitment and accountability, and ultimately provides a more effective framework for achieving meaningful reductions in emissions. Further, the flexibility to tailor carbon tax systems to specific national circumstances can quickly turn into a race to the bottom to protect politically favored industries.\nImpact: Winning this point is crucial because it redefines the framing of the debate. Instead of focusing solely on national sovereignty, it highlights the imperative of global cooperation to address climate change effectively.\n\nCLASH POINT 2\nOriginal Claim: \"A unified carbon trading market is susceptible to manipulation, fraud, and regulatory arbitrage, leading to carbon leakage and undermining emissions reduction efforts.\"\nChallenge Type: Counter Evidence\nChallenge: While the Opposition raises concerns about manipulation and fraud within carbon trading markets, exemplified by the EU ETS, these issues are not inherent to all such systems and can be mitigated through robust regulatory frameworks and international cooperation. The Europol report cited is from 2011 and the EU ETS has undergone significant reforms since then to address VAT fraud and improve market oversight. Moreover, the claim that carbon leakage offsets a significant portion of emissions reductions within the EU ETS is contested. A 2015 study by the European Commission found that carbon leakage effects in the EU ETS were relatively small. The existence of problems in one particular carbon trading market does not invalidate the potential for a well-designed and effectively regulated unified market to achieve significant emissions reductions. The EU-ETS is imperfect, but it is also the oldest and largest market, and thus the lessons learned there can ensure the success of a unified G20 carbon market.\nImpact: By refuting the claim that carbon trading markets are inherently prone to fraud and leakage, the Opposition strengthens the case for the PRO side's call for a unified carbon trading market.\n\nCLASH POINT 3\nOriginal Claim: \"Domestic carbon tax systems offer greater transparency, accountability, and revenue-raising potential for targeted climate investments.\"\nChallenge Type: Evidence Critique\nChallenge: The Opposition's assertion that domestic carbon tax systems offer greater transparency and accountability is not necessarily true. While transparency is possible, it may not always be implemented. Independent Carbon Policies are ultimately exposed to political pressures that can hinder consistent investment in green technologies. The revenue generated by domestic carbon taxes can be easily diverted to other government priorities, rather than being specifically earmarked for climate investments. Furthermore, domestic carbon tax policies are vulnerable to political interference and can be adjusted or repealed based on shifting political landscapes. A unified carbon market, with its standardized rules and international oversight, can provide a more consistent and accountable framework for ensuring that carbon revenues are actually used to support climate mitigation and adaptation efforts.\nImpact: By demonstrating that domestic carbon tax systems are not inherently more transparent or accountable than a unified carbon market, they diminish the advantages claimed by the opposition.\n\nDEFENSIVE ANALYSIS\nVulnerabilities:\n- PRO will likely argue that the benefits of global action far outweigh any compromise of national sovereignty.\n- PRO may cite examples of successful carbon tax systems as evidence that these are more effective\n- PRO will continue to place heavy focus on Tragedy of the Commons type arguments in favor of collaboration\nAdditional Support:\n- Stress the administrative burden and complexity of establishing and enforcing a G20-wide carbon trading market.\n- Highlight the potential for conflicts of interest and political maneuvering within a unified system.\n- Provide additional examples of failures or shortcomings of existing carbon trading markets.\nWhy We Prevail:\n- The opposition has presented a more realistic and nuanced view of the challenges and limitations of a unified carbon trading market.\n- The opposition's arguments regarding national sovereignty, potential for manipulation, and limited benefits of unified markets are more compelling.\n- The opposition's plan is more flexible and adaptable to the specific circumstances of individual countries, and presents an easier means of achieving emissions reduction outside of an ideal.\n\nWEIGHING\nKey Clash Points:\n- The central disagreement lies in whether the benefits of a unified carbon trading market outweigh the compromises on national sovereignty and the risks of manipulation and leakage.\n- The effectiveness of carbon taxes versus carbon trading markets as mechanisms for reducing emissions is another key point of contention.\nWhy We Win:\n- The opposition wins by demonstrating that the risks and limitations of a unified carbon trading market are significant and likely to undermine its effectiveness.\n- The opposition has shown that domestic carbon tax systems, while perhaps not perfect, offer a more practical and adaptable approach.\nOverall Impact:\n- Winning the debate proves that a unified carbon trading market is not necessarily the best way to address climate change and that individual nations should have the flexibility to design their own climate policies.\n\n",
      "closing": "FRAMING\nCore Questions:\n- The fundamental issue in this debate is whether a top-down, globally mandated carbon trading market is superior to allowing individual nations to tailor their own climate policies through carbon taxes.\n- The key decisions hinge on whether we prioritize theoretical efficiency and global coordination over practical realities, national sovereignty, and the potential for unintended consequences.\n- This debate should be evaluated based on which approach is more likely to achieve real, sustainable emissions reductions while respecting national autonomy and minimizing negative economic impacts.\n\nKEY CLASHES\nQuote: \"Our unified carbon market doesn't eliminate national flexibility entirely; G20 nations can still determine their own emissions reduction pathways within the framework of a standardized carbon price.\"\nOur Case Strength: This notion of \"flexibility within a framework\" is illusory. A standardized carbon price effectively dictates the emissions reduction pathway, severely limiting national autonomy. Our principle of subsidiarity, consistently articulated, argues that each nation possesses unique circumstances \u2013 economic structures, energy mixes, political realities \u2013 that demand tailored policy responses. A coal-dependent nation cannot simply adopt the same strategies as one powered by renewables. Our case is stronger because it acknowledges these complexities and respects the right of nations to self-determination in climate policy.\nTheir Response Gaps: They failed to adequately address the political backlash that can arise from imposing externally mandated policies. Resistance to perceived foreign interference can undermine the overall commitment and effectiveness of climate action. They also downplayed the importance of locally tailored revenue policies, which can be designed to mitigate negative economic impacts and garner public support.\nCrucial Impact: This clash matters fundamentally because it questions the very legitimacy of a top-down approach. If we win on national sovereignty and flexibility, we demonstrate that the proposition's plan is not only impractical but also potentially counterproductive, leading to decreased commitment and ineffective implementation.\n\nQuote: \"The opposition cites issues within the EU ETS, including fraud and carbon leakage, to argue against a unified carbon trading market. However, we contend that these problems are not inherent to carbon markets themselves, but rather reflect design flaws and enforcement weaknesses...\"\nOur Case Strength: Their claim that design flaws and enforcement weaknesses are easily rectified ignores the inherent challenges of regulating a complex, global market. The EU ETS, despite numerous reforms, continues to grapple with fraud, manipulation, and carbon leakage. Our evidence, specifically the 2011 Europol report, demonstrates the scale of these issues, and while they claim the EU ETS has undergone reforms, carbon leakage still very much remains a concern. We presented irrefutable proof of this. Implementing a G20-wide market vastly increases the opportunities for arbitrage and the difficulties of enforcement. Our case is stronger because it acknowledges these practical realities and highlights the potential for a unified market to become a breeding ground for abuse.\nTheir Response Gaps: They did not offer concrete, verifiable solutions to prevent fraud and manipulation in a G20 market. Their reliance on \"blockchain technology\" and \"international collaboration\" is vague and lacks the specificity needed to address the complex challenges involved. They also failed to acknowledge the immense administrative burden of establishing and enforcing a unified system across nations with vastly different legal frameworks.\nCrucial Impact: This clash is critical because it cuts to the heart of the feasibility of the proposition's plan. If we win on the susceptibility of carbon trading markets to manipulation and leakage, we demonstrate that their approach is fundamentally flawed and unlikely to achieve meaningful emissions reductions. In fact, it could exacerbate the problem by creating new avenues for abuse and undermining public trust in climate action.\n\nQuote: \"While local transparency is good, in carbon markets there are clear price signals and a centralized exchange that is visible for all participants; contrastingly, unilateral carbon taxes can vary widely in their application and stringency, making direct comparison of their effectiveness almost impossibly opaque.\"\nOur Case Strength: A centralized exchange does not equate to transparency and accountability for the *use* of carbon revenue. Domestic carbon tax systems offer greater potential for public scrutiny and government accountability. Citizens can see where the revenue goes and hold their governments accountable for its effective use. This is far preferable to a complex, opaque global market where proceeds from quarterly auctions could be diverted to other priorities with little oversight. A unified carbon market, with its standardized rules and international oversight, may seem more consistent, but a single framework is not always the best way to ensure fairness.\nTheir Response Gaps: They downplayed the political pressures that can undermine the effectiveness of unified carbon markets. In many countries, it is difficult to implement the necessary framework and regulations due to national political environments.\nCrucial Impact: This clash matters because it highlights the importance of accountability in climate action. If we win on transparency, we demonstrate that domestic carbon tax systems are more likely to deliver real benefits to the environment and to local communities.\n\nVOTING ISSUES\nPriority Analysis:\n- The most crucial clash is the balance between national sovereignty and global coordination. This underpins the entire debate because it determines whether we believe in a top-down, one-size-fits-all solution or a more flexible, nationally-driven approach.\n- The feasibility of preventing manipulation and leakage in a unified market is also paramount. If the system is inherently susceptible to abuse, it cannot be effective, regardless of its theoretical benefits.\nCase Proof:\n- Winning on national sovereignty proves our case because it demonstrates that imposing a unified system undermines effective climate policy.\n- Winning on manipulation and leakage proves our case because it shows that the proposition's plan is fundamentally flawed and unlikely to achieve its stated goals.\nFinal Weighing:\n- Any theoretical benefits of a unified market are outweighed by the practical challenges of implementation, the potential for unintended consequences, and the importance of respecting national autonomy.\n- Our arguments demonstrate that domestic carbon tax systems represent a more realistic, adaptable, and accountable approach to climate action.\n- Climate change is a complex issue that requires diverse solutions tailored to specific national contexts.\n\n"
