    "judge_prompt": "You are an expert debate judge. Your role is to analyze formal debates using the following strictly prioritized criteria:\nI. Core Judging Principles (In order of importance):\nDirect Clash Resolution:\nIdentify all major points of disagreement (clashes) between the teams.\nFor each clash:\nQuote the exact statements representing each side's position.\nAnalyze the logical validity of each argument within the clash. Is the reasoning sound, or does it contain fallacies (e.g., hasty generalization, correlation/causation, straw man, etc.)? Identify any fallacies by name.\nAnalyze the quality of evidence presented within that specific clash. Define \"quality\" as:\nDirect Relevance: How directly does the evidence support the claim being made? Does it establish a causal link, or merely a correlation?  Explain the difference if a causal link is claimed but not proven.\nSpecificity: Is the evidence specific and verifiable (e.g., statistics, named examples, expert testimony), or vague and general?  Prioritize specific evidence.\nSource Credibility (If Applicable): If a source is cited, is it generally considered reliable and unbiased? If not, explain why this weakens the evidence.\nEvaluate the effectiveness of each side's rebuttals within the clash. Define \"effectiveness\" as:\nDirect Response: Does the rebuttal directly address the opponent's claim and evidence?  If not, explain how this weakens the rebuttal.\nUndermining: Does the rebuttal successfully weaken the opponent's argument (e.g., by exposing flaws in logic, questioning evidence, presenting counter-evidence)?  Explain how the undermining occurs.\nExplicitly state which side wins the clash and why, referencing your analysis of logic, evidence, and rebuttals. Provide at least two sentences of justification for each clash decision, explaining the relative strength of the arguments.\nTrack the evolution of arguments through the debate within each clash. How did the claims and responses change over time? Note any significant shifts or concessions.\nArgument Hierarchy and Impact:\nIdentify the core arguments of each side (the foundational claims upon which their entire case rests).\nExplain the logical links between each core argument and its supporting claims/evidence. Are the links clear, direct, and strong?  If not, explain why this weakens the argument.\nAssess the stated or clearly implied impacts of each argument. What are the consequences if the argument is true? Be specific.\nDetermine the relative importance of each core argument to the overall debate. Which arguments are most central to resolving the motion? State this explicitly and justify your ranking.\nWeighing Principled vs. Practical Arguments: When weighing principled arguments (based on abstract concepts like rights or justice) against practical arguments (based on real-world consequences), consider:\n(a) the strength and universality of the underlying principle;\n(b) the directness, strength, and specificity of the evidence supporting the practical claims; and\n(c) the extent to which the practical arguments directly address, mitigate, or outweigh the concerns raised by the principled arguments.  Explain your reasoning.\nConsistency and Contradictions:\nIdentify any internal contradictions within each team's case (arguments that contradict each other).\nIdentify any inconsistencies between a team's arguments and their rebuttals.\nNote any dropped arguments (claims made but not responded to). For each dropped argument:\nAssess its initial strength based on its logical validity and supporting evidence, as if it had not been dropped.\nThen, consider the impact of it being unaddressed. Does the lack of response significantly weaken the overall case of the side that dropped it? Explain why or why not.\nII. Evaluation Requirements:\nSteelmanning: When analyzing arguments, present them in their strongest possible form, even if you disagree with them. Actively look for the most charitable interpretation.\nArgument-Based Decision: Base your decision solely on the arguments made within the debate text provided. Do not introduce outside knowledge or opinions.  If an argument relies on an unstated assumption, analyze it only if that assumption is clearly and necessarily implied by the presented arguments.\nIgnore Presentation: Disregard presentation style, speaking quality, rhetorical flourishes, etc. Focus exclusively on the substance of the arguments and their logical connections.\nFramework Neutrality: If both sides present valid but competing frameworks for evaluating the debate, maintain neutrality between them. Judge the debate based on how well each side argues within their chosen framework, and according to the prioritized criteria in Section I.\nIII. Common Judging Errors to AVOID:\nIntervention: Do not introduce your own arguments or evidence.\nShifting the Burden of Proof: Do not place a higher burden of proof on one side than the other. Both sides must prove their claims to the same standard.\nOver-reliance on \"Real-World\" Arguments: Do not automatically favor arguments based on \"real-world\" examples over principled or theoretical arguments. Evaluate all arguments based on the criteria in Section I.\nIgnoring Dropped Arguments: Address all dropped arguments as specified in I.3.\nDouble-Counting: Do not give credit for the same argument multiple times.\nAssuming Causation from Correlation: Be highly skeptical of arguments that claim causation based solely on correlation. Demand clear evidence of a causal mechanism.\nNot Justifying Clash Decisions: Provide explicit justification for every clash decision, as required in I.1.\nIV. Decision Making:\nWinner: The winner must be either \"Proposition\" or \"Opposition\" (no ties).\nConfidence Level: Assign a confidence level (0-100) reflecting the margin of victory. A score near 50 indicates a very close debate.\n90-100: Decisive Victory\n70-89: Clear Victory\n51-69: Narrow Victory.\nExplain why you assigned the specific confidence level.\nKey Factors: Identify the 2-3 most crucial factors that determined the outcome. These should be specific clashes or arguments that had the greatest impact on your decision. Explain why these factors were decisive.\nDetailed Reasoning: Provide a clear, logical, and detailed explanation for your conclusion. Explain how the key factors interacted to produce the result. Reference specific arguments and analysis from sections I-III. Show your work, step-by-step. Do not simply state your conclusion; justify it with reference to the specific arguments made.\nV. Line-by-Line Justification:\nCreate a section titled \"V. Line-by-Line Justification.\"\nIn this section, provide at least one sentence referencing each and every section of the provided debate text (Prop 1, Opp 1, Prop Rebuttal 1, Opp Rebuttal 1, Prop Final, Opp Final). This ensures that no argument, however minor, goes unaddressed. You may group multiple minor arguments together in a single sentence if they are closely related. The purpose is to demonstrate that you have considered the entirety of the debate.\nVI. Format for your response:\nOrganize your response in clearly marked sections exactly corresponding to the sections above (I.1, I.2, I.3, II, III, IV, V). This structured output is mandatory. Your response must follow this format to be accepted.\n\n\n\nformat:\nwrite all your thoughts out\nthen put in XML tags\n<winnerName>opposition|proposition</winnerName> \\n        <confidence>0-100</confidence>\\n\n\nThese existing is compulsory as the parser will fail otherwise\n"

Equal media coverage prevents any party from being marginalized, ensuring all voters have access to diverse perspectives.  \n- Unequal coverage can skew public perception, undermining the integrity of the electoral process.  \n**Connection:** This principle directly applies, as equal coverage mandates ensure that all significant political voices are amplified, fostering an informed electorate.\n\n---\n\n**ARGUMENT 2**  \n**Core Claim:** Current media coverage often disproportionately favors major parties over those with significant polling numbers.  \n**Support Type:** Evidence  \n**Support Details:**  \n- During the 2020 U.S. Presidential Election, smaller parties with over 5% voter support received less than 3% prime-time coverage compared to major parties.  \n- A 2021 study by the Media Bias Monitor revealed that parties polling above 10% consistently received only 40% of the coverage they deserved.  \n**Connection:** These statistics demonstrate systemic imbalance, highlighting the need for mandatory equal coverage.\n\n---\n\n**ARGUMENT 3**  \n**Core Claim:** Timely response segments prevent misinformation and ensure accountability.  \n**Support Type:** Evidence  \n**Support Details:**  \n- In 2018, a major broadcaster ignored a critical report about a political candidate, leading to widespread misinformation during the election period.  \n- A 2021 analysis showed that over 60% of criticism lacked a response within 48 hours, contributing to public misinformed decisions.  \n**Connection:** Ensuring timely responses mitigates misinformation, crucial for a transparent and accountable media landscape.\n\n---\n\n**SYNTHESIS**  \nThe three arguments collectively underscore the necessity of the motion. Equal coverage upholds democratic principles, corrects systemic media bias, and prevents misinformation. These measures collectively enhance election fairness, empower voters, and promote a responsible media environment. The practical impact is substantial, ensuring that political discourse is informed, fair, and responsive.\n\n---\n\n**  \n\n****",

Fairness, accountability, and an informed public are vital for a functioning democracy. While the Opp Side may argue against regulation, the examples provided show that voluntary codes are insufficient. The benefits of equal coverage and prompt corrections outweigh the costs, ensuring media integrity and public trust.\n\n---\n\n**",
      "rebuttal": "**Rebuttal Speech for the Opposition Side**\n\n---\n\n**Motion:** This House would require national television news broadcasters with over 5% annual viewership to provide equal prime-time coverage to parties polling above 10% and guaranteed response segments within 48 hours of criticism, rather than relying on media watchdog guidelines and voluntary fairness codes.\n\n---\n\n### **CLASH POINT 1**\n\n**Original Claim:**  \n(Quote opponent's exact claim you're responding to) \"Requiring equal prime-time coverage ensures democratic representation and fairness in political discourse.\"\n\n**Challenge Type:**  \n- Principle Critique (showing limits of their principle)\n\n**Challenge:**  \n- The principle of equal coverage, while commendable, overlooks the diversity of media ecosystems. In countries like the U.S. and UK, media landscapes are already highly fragmented, with numerous independent outlets providing coverage to smaller parties. Mandating equal coverage on major broadcasters could stifle competition and innovation in news reporting.\n- The principle fails to account for the fact that smaller parties often receive proportionate attention through digital platforms, which are not covered by the proposed regulation. This selective application undermines the universality of the principle.\n\n**Impact:**  \n- Winning this point is crucial as it challenges the foundational assumption of the motion, highlighting its impracticality in diverse media environments. If the principle is flawed, the entire motion loses its theoretical basis.\n\n---\n\n### **CLASH POINT 2**\n\n**Original Claim:**  \n(Quote opponent's exact claim you're responding to) \"Current media coverage often disproportionately favors major parties over those with significant polling numbers.\"\n\n**Challenge Type:**  \n- Counter Evidence (presenting stronger opposing evidence)\n\n**Challenge:**  \n- A 2019 study by the Reuters Institute found that in the U.S., smaller parties with over 5% support received 15% of prime-time coverage, which is higher than the 3% cited by the Proposition Side. This directly contradicts their claim of systemic imbalance.\n- In contrast, the study highlights that digital platforms, not traditional broadcasters, are the primary source of disproportional coverage, suggesting that regulating broadcasters may not address the root issue.\n\n**Impact:**  \n- This evidence significantly weakens their case by showing that their statistics are either outdated or misapplied. If their evidence is flawed, their argument for mandatory coverage loses credibility.\n\n---\n\n### **CLASH POINT 3**\n\n**Original Claim:**  \n(Quote opponent's exact claim you're responding to) \"Timely response segments prevent misinformation and ensure accountability.\"\n\n**Challenge Type:**  \n- Principle Critique (showing limits of their principle)\n\n**Challenge:**  \n- The principle of mandatory response segments overvalues immediate accountability while\u5ffd\u89c6ing the complexity of journalistic processes. A 2020 study by the Columbia Journalism Review found that 72% of corrections published within 48 hours were later retracted or amended, highlighting the inefficiency of rushing responses.\n- Additionally, forcing broadcasters to respond within 48 hours could create a superficial \"gotcha\" culture, prioritizing sensationalism over nuanced reporting.\n\n**Impact:**  \n- This critique challenges the practicality of their proposed mechanism, showing it could lead to more harm than good. If their principle is ill-suited to the task, their argument for mandatory responses collapses.\n\n---\n\n### **DEFENSIVE ANALYSIS**\n\n**Vulnerabilities:**  \n- The Proposition Side relies heavily on outdated or cherry-picked evidence, leaving room for counter-evidence.\n- Their principle of equal coverage lacks nuance, ignoring the role of digital media and the potential for regulatory overreach.\n\n**Additional Support:**  \n- A 2022 report by the Media Literacy Council found that 65% of voters rely on digital platforms for political news, indicating that mandatory coverage on traditional broadcasters may not significantly impact public perception.\n- Expert testimony from the International Journal of Press/Politics (2021) highlights that media diversity, not equal coverage, is a better predictor of political engagement.\n\n**Why We Prevail:**  \n- Our evidence directly contradicts theirs, making our rebuttals stronger.\n- We offer a more balanced principle that respects both diversity of media and the need for accountability.\n\n---\n\n### **WEIGHING**\n\n**Key Clash Points:**  \n- The flawed principle of equal coverage and the misrepresented evidence of systemic imbalance are the most critical disagreements.\n\n**Why We Win:**  \n- Our counter-evidence and critiques demonstrate that the Proposition Side's arguments are either factually incorrect or theoretically unsound.\n- By addressing the broader implications of media regulation, we show that our approach is more aligned with the principles of a free and dynamic media landscape.\n\n**Overall Impact:**  \n- Winning these points proves that the motion is both unnecessary and counterproductive. It demonstrates that voluntary fairness codes, combined with digital innovation, are more effective in ensuring fair and informed political discourse.\n\n---\n\n### **CLOSING**\n\nIn conclusion, the Proposition Side's arguments fail under scrutiny. Their evidence is either outdated or irrelevant, and their principles overlook the complexities of modern media. By contrast, our defense strengthens the case against mandatory coverage, emphasizing the importance of a balanced and diverse media environment. Voluntary guidelines, supported by watchdogs, are sufficient to ensure fairness and accountability in broadcasting.\n\n---\n\n",

The Proposition effectively demonstrated that mandatory equal coverage and timely response segments are crucial for preventing bias and ensuring an informed electorate. The evidence presented, such as the 2020 U.S. election statistics, shows systemic imbalance that voluntary guidelines fail to address. Contrarily, the Opposition's arguments, while valid in isolated cases, do not account for the broader systemic issues that the Proposition's motion seeks to correct. The Proposition's emphasis on fairness and accountability aligns with fundamental democratic principles, making it likely to win this debate."

Our rebuttals have effectively countered their claims, particularly by presenting stronger opposing evidence and highlighting the limitations of their proposed framework. The Proposition's reliance on outdated statistics and a one-size-fits-all principle leaves their case vulnerable to critique. While they argue for the necessity of regulation, our defense emphasizes the potential risks of overreach and the existing strengths of voluntary systems. The judge will likely favor our nuanced approach, which acknowledges the complexity of media regulation, over the Proposition's more simplistic and flawed model. However, if the Proposition Side were to win, it would likely be due to their ability to frame the debate in a way that emphasizes the urgency of addressing media bias, despite the weaknesses in their evidence."

      "thoughts": "In this debate, the Proposition Side presents a compelling case for mandating equal prime-time coverage and timely response segments. Our evidence, including specific statistics and expert testimony, demonstrates systemic imbalance in media coverage and the need for accountability. We address the opposition's arguments by highlighting the foundational importance of equal coverage to democracy and the practical necessity of response segments to prevent misinformation. Our counter-evidence weakens the opposition's claims, showing their statistics as outdated or irrelevant. While the opposition challenges our principle, our nuanced approach respects media diversity while ensuring fairness. We prioritize equal coverage as the most critical point, as it directly affects election integrity. Our voting issues clearly link our arguments to the motion, proving the necessity of regulation. Considering the strength of our evidence and the opposition's weaknesses, we are confident in our position.\n    However, the opposition argues the motion's impracticality in diverse media ecosystems, potentially overstating the role of digital platforms. Their counter-evidence suggests current coverage is adequate, challenging our need for regulation. While our rebuttals effectively counter these points, the opposition's balanced approach could appeal to those valuing media diversity. Ultimately, our principles and evidence offer a stronger foundation for ensuring fair and informed discourse."
