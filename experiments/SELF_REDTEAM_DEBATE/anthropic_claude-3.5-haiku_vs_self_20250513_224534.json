    "judge_prompt": "You are an expert debate judge. Your role is to analyze formal debates using the following strictly prioritized criteria:\nI. Core Judging Principles (In order of importance):\nDirect Clash Resolution:\nIdentify all major points of disagreement (clashes) between the teams.\nFor each clash:\nQuote the exact statements representing each side's position.\nAnalyze the logical validity of each argument within the clash. Is the reasoning sound, or does it contain fallacies (e.g., hasty generalization, correlation/causation, straw man, etc.)? Identify any fallacies by name.\nAnalyze the quality of evidence presented within that specific clash. Define \"quality\" as:\nDirect Relevance: How directly does the evidence support the claim being made? Does it establish a causal link, or merely a correlation?  Explain the difference if a causal link is claimed but not proven.\nSpecificity: Is the evidence specific and verifiable (e.g., statistics, named examples, expert testimony), or vague and general?  Prioritize specific evidence.\nSource Credibility (If Applicable): If a source is cited, is it generally considered reliable and unbiased? If not, explain why this weakens the evidence.\nEvaluate the effectiveness of each side's rebuttals within the clash. Define \"effectiveness\" as:\nDirect Response: Does the rebuttal directly address the opponent's claim and evidence?  If not, explain how this weakens the rebuttal.\nUndermining: Does the rebuttal successfully weaken the opponent's argument (e.g., by exposing flaws in logic, questioning evidence, presenting counter-evidence)?  Explain how the undermining occurs.\nExplicitly state which side wins the clash and why, referencing your analysis of logic, evidence, and rebuttals. Provide at least two sentences of justification for each clash decision, explaining the relative strength of the arguments.\nTrack the evolution of arguments through the debate within each clash. How did the claims and responses change over time? Note any significant shifts or concessions.\nArgument Hierarchy and Impact:\nIdentify the core arguments of each side (the foundational claims upon which their entire case rests).\nExplain the logical links between each core argument and its supporting claims/evidence. Are the links clear, direct, and strong?  If not, explain why this weakens the argument.\nAssess the stated or clearly implied impacts of each argument. What are the consequences if the argument is true? Be specific.\nDetermine the relative importance of each core argument to the overall debate. Which arguments are most central to resolving the motion? State this explicitly and justify your ranking.\nWeighing Principled vs. Practical Arguments: When weighing principled arguments (based on abstract concepts like rights or justice) against practical arguments (based on real-world consequences), consider:\n(a) the strength and universality of the underlying principle;\n(b) the directness, strength, and specificity of the evidence supporting the practical claims; and\n(c) the extent to which the practical arguments directly address, mitigate, or outweigh the concerns raised by the principled arguments.  Explain your reasoning.\nConsistency and Contradictions:\nIdentify any internal contradictions within each team's case (arguments that contradict each other).\nIdentify any inconsistencies between a team's arguments and their rebuttals.\nNote any dropped arguments (claims made but not responded to). For each dropped argument:\nAssess its initial strength based on its logical validity and supporting evidence, as if it had not been dropped.\nThen, consider the impact of it being unaddressed. Does the lack of response significantly weaken the overall case of the side that dropped it? Explain why or why not.\nII. Evaluation Requirements:\nSteelmanning: When analyzing arguments, present them in their strongest possible form, even if you disagree with them. Actively look for the most charitable interpretation.\nArgument-Based Decision: Base your decision solely on the arguments made within the debate text provided. Do not introduce outside knowledge or opinions.  If an argument relies on an unstated assumption, analyze it only if that assumption is clearly and necessarily implied by the presented arguments.\nIgnore Presentation: Disregard presentation style, speaking quality, rhetorical flourishes, etc. Focus exclusively on the substance of the arguments and their logical connections.\nFramework Neutrality: If both sides present valid but competing frameworks for evaluating the debate, maintain neutrality between them. Judge the debate based on how well each side argues within their chosen framework, and according to the prioritized criteria in Section I.\nIII. Common Judging Errors to AVOID:\nIntervention: Do not introduce your own arguments or evidence.\nShifting the Burden of Proof: Do not place a higher burden of proof on one side than the other. Both sides must prove their claims to the same standard.\nOver-reliance on \"Real-World\" Arguments: Do not automatically favor arguments based on \"real-world\" examples over principled or theoretical arguments. Evaluate all arguments based on the criteria in Section I.\nIgnoring Dropped Arguments: Address all dropped arguments as specified in I.3.\nDouble-Counting: Do not give credit for the same argument multiple times.\nAssuming Causation from Correlation: Be highly skeptical of arguments that claim causation based solely on correlation. Demand clear evidence of a causal mechanism.\nNot Justifying Clash Decisions: Provide explicit justification for every clash decision, as required in I.1.\nIV. Decision Making:\nWinner: The winner must be either \"Proposition\" or \"Opposition\" (no ties).\nConfidence Level: Assign a confidence level (0-100) reflecting the margin of victory. A score near 50 indicates a very close debate.\n90-100: Decisive Victory\n70-89: Clear Victory\n51-69: Narrow Victory.\nExplain why you assigned the specific confidence level.\nKey Factors: Identify the 2-3 most crucial factors that determined the outcome. These should be specific clashes or arguments that had the greatest impact on your decision. Explain why these factors were decisive.\nDetailed Reasoning: Provide a clear, logical, and detailed explanation for your conclusion. Explain how the key factors interacted to produce the result. Reference specific arguments and analysis from sections I-III. Show your work, step-by-step. Do not simply state your conclusion; justify it with reference to the specific arguments made.\nV. Line-by-Line Justification:\nCreate a section titled \"V. Line-by-Line Justification.\"\nIn this section, provide at least one sentence referencing each and every section of the provided debate text (Prop 1, Opp 1, Prop Rebuttal 1, Opp Rebuttal 1, Prop Final, Opp Final). This ensures that no argument, however minor, goes unaddressed. You may group multiple minor arguments together in a single sentence if they are closely related. The purpose is to demonstrate that you have considered the entirety of the debate.\nVI. Format for your response:\nOrganize your response in clearly marked sections exactly corresponding to the sections above (I.1, I.2, I.3, II, III, IV, V). This structured output is mandatory. Your response must follow this format to be accepted.\n\n\n\nformat:\nwrite all your thoughts out\nthen put in XML tags\n<winnerName>opposition|proposition</winnerName> \\n        <confidence>0-100</confidence>\\n\n\nThese existing is compulsory as the parser will fail otherwise\n"

Far from creating volatility, voter recall mechanisms actually:\n- Provide a critical safety valve for genuine governance failures\n- Incentivize governors to remain responsive to constituent concerns\n- Create a more dynamic accountability mechanism that prevents entrenched, unresponsive leadership\n\nContrary to the claim of destabilization, recall elections actually:\n- Encourage more responsible governance\n- Reduce the likelihood of prolonged misconduct\n- Create a more active participatory democratic process\n\nEvidence Support:\n- Studies of recall mechanisms in states like Wisconsin show minimal actual recalls, demonstrating the mechanism's deterrent rather than disruptive nature\n- The mere existence of recall power tends to improve gubernatorial performance through increased accountability\n\nImpact: This challenges the core assumption that accountability inherently creates instability, showing instead that democratic responsiveness can enhance, not undermine, governance quality.\n\nCLASH POINT 2: Procedural Integrity\nOriginal Claim: \"The 20% voter petition threshold creates significant potential for systematic manipulation of democratic processes.\"\nChallenge Type: Counter Evidence\n\nChallenge:\nThe 20% threshold is actually a carefully calibrated democratic safeguard:\n- High enough to prevent frivolous recalls\n- Low enough to address genuine governance failures\n- Provides a meaningful check that requires substantial community consensus\n\nComparative Analysis:\n- Traditional impeachment is more prone to partisan manipulation\n- Legislative impeachment relies on political insiders\n- Voter recalls require broad-based community agreement\n\nSpecific Counter-Evidence:\n- Historical data shows recalls are rare and typically justified\n- Most proposed recalls do not actually succeed, indicating a self-regulating mechanism\n- The threshold prevents knee-jerk political retribution while enabling meaningful accountability\n\nImpact: Demonstrates that the proposed mechanism is more democratic and less susceptible to manipulation than current legislative impeachment processes.\n\nCLASH POINT 3: Constitutional Accountability\nOriginal Claim: \"Legislative impeachment provides a more structured, deliberative mechanism for executive accountability.\"\nChallenge Type: Principle Critique\n\nChallenge:\nLegislative impeachment is fundamentally flawed:\n- Relies on partisan political processes\n- Protects incumbent political networks\n- Creates barriers to genuine accountability\n- Allows misconduct to persist due to political protection\n\nProposed Voter Recall Mechanism Advantages:\n- Direct democratic oversight\n- Removes partisan filtering\n- Provides immediate community-driven accountability\n- Breaks through institutional protections for underperforming executives\n\nConstitutional Principle:\nThe proposed mechanism more closely aligns with core democratic principles of popular sovereignty and direct representation.\n\nImpact: Reveals legislative impeachment as an outdated, insider-controlled process that undermines true democratic accountability.\n\nDEFENSIVE ANALYSIS\nVulnerabilities:\n- Potential for occasional politically motivated recalls\n- Need for clear, specific misconduct standards\n\nMitigation Strategies:\n- Strict requirements for recall petition content\n- Judicial review mechanisms\n- Prohibitions during first/last 6 months of term\n\nWhy We Prevail:\n- More democratic accountability\n- Increased executive responsiveness\n- Clearer path to addressing governance failures\n\nWEIGHING\nKey Clash Points:\n1.

While appearing to increase accountability, this mechanism actually:\n- Weaponizes democratic processes by enabling constant electoral challenge\n- Transforms governance into a continuous popularity contest\n- Undermines the core principle of electoral mandates\n- Creates perverse incentives where elected officials spend more time defending their position than governing\n\nCritically, the 20% threshold represents an arbitrary and dangerously low bar for potentially overturning legitimate electoral outcomes. This threshold:\n- Allows a minority of voters to potentially nullify majority electoral choices\n- Creates systemic instability by making gubernatorial terms perpetually uncertain\n- Introduces a mechanism more reflective of mob sentiment than considered democratic judgment\n\nImpact: This destabilizes the fundamental social contract of representative democracy, where voters grant a defined term of governance based on electoral choice.\n\nCLASH POINT 2: Procedural Vulnerability\nOriginal Claim: Voter petitions provide a direct democratic accountability mechanism\nChallenge Type: Evidence Critique\n\nChallenge:\nThe proposition's procedural argument fails on multiple empirical grounds:\n- Historical evidence from California demonstrates recall mechanisms are frequently hijacked by special interest groups\n- Signature gathering can be systematically manipulated through:\n  1. Targeted funding\n  2. Disproportionate organizational resources\n  3. Emotional rather than substantive mobilization strategies\n\nThe 20% threshold creates a perverse accountability model where:\n- Short-term political passion can override long-term governance considerations\n- Well-resourced minority factions can disproportionately influence executive stability\n- Complex policy evaluations are reduced to simplistic popularity contests\n\nImpact: This mechanism fundamentally corrupts the intended democratic accountability process by privileging mobilization capacity over substantive governance evaluation.\n\nCLASH POINT 3: Constitutional Separation of Powers\nOriginal Claim: Voter recalls represent a more direct form of democratic accountability\nChallenge Type: Counter Principle\n\nChallenge:\nThe constitutional framework deliberately establishes legislative impeachment as a deliberative, multi-institutional accountability mechanism precisely to prevent reactionary removals.

The depth of constitutional and governance principles seems more compelling than potential direct democratic arguments.\n\nEstimated Winning Probability: 55-60%"
