    "judge_prompt": "You are an expert debate judge. Your role is to analyze formal debates using the following strictly prioritized criteria:\nI. Core Judging Principles (In order of importance):\nDirect Clash Resolution:\nIdentify all major points of disagreement (clashes) between the teams.\nFor each clash:\nQuote the exact statements representing each side's position.\nAnalyze the logical validity of each argument within the clash. Is the reasoning sound, or does it contain fallacies (e.g., hasty generalization, correlation/causation, straw man, etc.)? Identify any fallacies by name.\nAnalyze the quality of evidence presented within that specific clash. Define \"quality\" as:\nDirect Relevance: How directly does the evidence support the claim being made? Does it establish a causal link, or merely a correlation?  Explain the difference if a causal link is claimed but not proven.\nSpecificity: Is the evidence specific and verifiable (e.g., statistics, named examples, expert testimony), or vague and general?  Prioritize specific evidence.\nSource Credibility (If Applicable): If a source is cited, is it generally considered reliable and unbiased? If not, explain why this weakens the evidence.\nEvaluate the effectiveness of each side's rebuttals within the clash. Define \"effectiveness\" as:\nDirect Response: Does the rebuttal directly address the opponent's claim and evidence?  If not, explain how this weakens the rebuttal.\nUndermining: Does the rebuttal successfully weaken the opponent's argument (e.g., by exposing flaws in logic, questioning evidence, presenting counter-evidence)?  Explain how the undermining occurs.\nExplicitly state which side wins the clash and why, referencing your analysis of logic, evidence, and rebuttals. Provide at least two sentences of justification for each clash decision, explaining the relative strength of the arguments.\nTrack the evolution of arguments through the debate within each clash. How did the claims and responses change over time? Note any significant shifts or concessions.\nArgument Hierarchy and Impact:\nIdentify the core arguments of each side (the foundational claims upon which their entire case rests).\nExplain the logical links between each core argument and its supporting claims/evidence. Are the links clear, direct, and strong?  If not, explain why this weakens the argument.\nAssess the stated or clearly implied impacts of each argument. What are the consequences if the argument is true? Be specific.\nDetermine the relative importance of each core argument to the overall debate. Which arguments are most central to resolving the motion? State this explicitly and justify your ranking.\nWeighing Principled vs. Practical Arguments: When weighing principled arguments (based on abstract concepts like rights or justice) against practical arguments (based on real-world consequences), consider:\n(a) the strength and universality of the underlying principle;\n(b) the directness, strength, and specificity of the evidence supporting the practical claims; and\n(c) the extent to which the practical arguments directly address, mitigate, or outweigh the concerns raised by the principled arguments.  Explain your reasoning.\nConsistency and Contradictions:\nIdentify any internal contradictions within each team's case (arguments that contradict each other).\nIdentify any inconsistencies between a team's arguments and their rebuttals.\nNote any dropped arguments (claims made but not responded to). For each dropped argument:\nAssess its initial strength based on its logical validity and supporting evidence, as if it had not been dropped.\nThen, consider the impact of it being unaddressed. Does the lack of response significantly weaken the overall case of the side that dropped it? Explain why or why not.\nII. Evaluation Requirements:\nSteelmanning: When analyzing arguments, present them in their strongest possible form, even if you disagree with them. Actively look for the most charitable interpretation.\nArgument-Based Decision: Base your decision solely on the arguments made within the debate text provided. Do not introduce outside knowledge or opinions.  If an argument relies on an unstated assumption, analyze it only if that assumption is clearly and necessarily implied by the presented arguments.\nIgnore Presentation: Disregard presentation style, speaking quality, rhetorical flourishes, etc. Focus exclusively on the substance of the arguments and their logical connections.\nFramework Neutrality: If both sides present valid but competing frameworks for evaluating the debate, maintain neutrality between them. Judge the debate based on how well each side argues within their chosen framework, and according to the prioritized criteria in Section I.\nIII. Common Judging Errors to AVOID:\nIntervention: Do not introduce your own arguments or evidence.\nShifting the Burden of Proof: Do not place a higher burden of proof on one side than the other. Both sides must prove their claims to the same standard.\nOver-reliance on \"Real-World\" Arguments: Do not automatically favor arguments based on \"real-world\" examples over principled or theoretical arguments. Evaluate all arguments based on the criteria in Section I.\nIgnoring Dropped Arguments: Address all dropped arguments as specified in I.3.\nDouble-Counting: Do not give credit for the same argument multiple times.\nAssuming Causation from Correlation: Be highly skeptical of arguments that claim causation based solely on correlation. Demand clear evidence of a causal mechanism.\nNot Justifying Clash Decisions: Provide explicit justification for every clash decision, as required in I.1.\nIV. Decision Making:\nWinner: The winner must be either \"Proposition\" or \"Opposition\" (no ties).\nConfidence Level: Assign a confidence level (0-100) reflecting the margin of victory. A score near 50 indicates a very close debate.\n90-100: Decisive Victory\n70-89: Clear Victory\n51-69: Narrow Victory.\nExplain why you assigned the specific confidence level.\nKey Factors: Identify the 2-3 most crucial factors that determined the outcome. These should be specific clashes or arguments that had the greatest impact on your decision. Explain why these factors were decisive.\nDetailed Reasoning: Provide a clear, logical, and detailed explanation for your conclusion. Explain how the key factors interacted to produce the result. Reference specific arguments and analysis from sections I-III. Show your work, step-by-step. Do not simply state your conclusion; justify it with reference to the specific arguments made.\nV. Line-by-Line Justification:\nCreate a section titled \"V. Line-by-Line Justification.\"\nIn this section, provide at least one sentence referencing each and every section of the provided debate text (Prop 1, Opp 1, Prop Rebuttal 1, Opp Rebuttal 1, Prop Final, Opp Final). This ensures that no argument, however minor, goes unaddressed. You may group multiple minor arguments together in a single sentence if they are closely related. The purpose is to demonstrate that you have considered the entirety of the debate.\nVI. Format for your response:\nOrganize your response in clearly marked sections exactly corresponding to the sections above (I.1, I.2, I.3, II, III, IV, V). This structured output is mandatory. Your response must follow this format to be accepted.\n\n\n\nformat:\nwrite all your thoughts out\nthen put in XML tags\n<winnerName>opposition|proposition</winnerName> \\n        <confidence>0-100</confidence>\\n\n\nThese existing is compulsory as the parser will fail otherwise\n"

      "opening": "Here is my opening speech arguing in favor of the motion: \"This House believes that professors should actively engage in public advocacy on social and political issues within their field of expertise.\"\n\n**OPENING SPEECH STRUCTURE**\n\n**ARGUMENT 1**\nCore Claim: Public advocacy by professors enhances the quality of public discourse and decision-making.\nSupport Type: PRINCIPLE\nSupport Details:\n- Explain the key principle/framework: The principle at play is that informed decisions are better decisions. Public discourse benefits from expertise. Professors, by definition, possess deep knowledge and understanding within their fields. Their engagement translates specialized knowledge into accessible information for the public, enriching the quality of debate and policy formulation.\n- Show why it is valid/important: This principle is valid because complex social and political issues often require specialized knowledge to understand their nuances and potential consequences. Ignoring expert opinions leads to poorly informed policies, susceptible to misinformation and manipulation. Furthermore, academic freedom is predicated on the idea that the pursuit and dissemination of knowledge is a public good.\n- Demonstrate how it applies here: When a professor of environmental science advocates for climate action, they bring in-depth knowledge of climate models, environmental impacts, and potential mitigation strategies to the public conversation. This ensures that policy discussions are grounded in scientific evidence rather than populist sentiments or misinformation campaigns funded by vested interests. When an economics professor explains the impact of tax policies, they bring rigorous analysis to bear on a debate often dominated by ideology.\n\nConnection: By offering evidence-based insights, professors can improve public understanding of complex issues, leading to better informed policies and a more effective democracy. Their contributions act as a corrective against misinformation and simplistic narratives.\n\n**ARGUMENT 2**\nCore Claim: Public advocacy fulfills professors' social responsibility to contribute to the betterment of society.\nSupport Type: PRINCIPLE\nSupport Details:\n- Explain the key principle/framework: This is based on the principle of social responsibility. Professors, as members of society, have a duty to use their knowledge and expertise to address societal problems. Their training and access to research tools position them uniquely to identify, analyze, and propose solutions to these problems.\n- Show why it is valid/important: Professors are often funded by public resources, either directly through state universities or indirectly through federal research grants. This creates an obligation to use their knowledge for the public good and address issues that affect society. Furthermore, a university's mission is often predicated on the idea of service to the public.\n- Demonstrate how it applies here: A professor of public health has a moral obligation to advocate for policies that promote public health, such as vaccinations or access to healthcare, particularly during a pandemic despite external pressures to stay silent. A professor of law should advocate for reforms within the legal system that promote justice and equity, especially when their expertise shows that certain laws are discriminatory or ineffective.\n\nConnection: By engaging in public advocacy, professors fulfill their ethical obligation to use their expertise to address pressing societal challenges, contributing to a more just and equitable society. This goes beyond publishing academic papers that only a limited audience can access and ensures that knowledge is translated into action.\n\n**ARGUMENT 3**\nCore Claim: Public advocacy encourages critical thinking and intellectual engagement among students.\nSupport Type: EVIDENCE\nSupport Details:\n  - Provide specific examples with dates/numbers: Studies on student engagement in civic activities (e.g., \"The Engaged University: International Perspectives on Civic Engagement\" by Andrew Furco and Patti H. Clayton, 2013) show that when faculty are involved in public advocacy, students are more likely to participate in civic activities and engage in critical thinking about social and political issues.\n  - Include real world cases and outcomes: Professors who lead public demonstrations, write op-eds explaining their research, or testify before governmental bodies are more likely to inspire similar actions from students. For example, professors involved in the Civil Rights movement frequently had their students alongside them. These students learned about social inequities and how to address them through first-hand experience.\n  - Show clear relevance to the topic: When professors model active engagement in public discourse, they empower students to think critically about societal issues. This provides students with the skills and experiences relevant to solving pressing social and political problems.\n\nConnection: By modeling active engagement in public advocacy, professors inspire students to become informed and engaged citizens, thereby contributing to a more vibrant and democratic society. When students see their professors using their expertise to advocate for specific changes, it instils in them a sense of civic responsibility.\n\n**SYNTHESIS**\nOur arguments demonstrate that professors' public advocacy is crucial for enhancing informed public discourse, fulfilling their social responsibility, and fostering civic engagement among students. These actions collectively contribute to a more informed, ethical, and democratic society. The expertise of professors bridges the gap between academic research and public policy, ensuring that decisions are grounded in facts and evidence. Their advocacy also serves as a powerful example for students, encouraging them to become active and engaged citizens. Ultimately, allowing and encouraging public advocacy from professors ensures that societal progress will be guided by expert voices.\n\n",
      "rebuttal": "**REBUTTAL SPEECH**\n\nCLASH POINT 1\nOriginal Claim: Active public advocacy by professors within their fields of expertise will undermine the perceived objectivity and credibility of academic research.\nChallenge Type: Counter Principle\nChallenge: The principle of academic objectivity, while important, should not be used to silence expert voices on matters of public concern. The opposing side frames objectivity as a purely passive stance, where any form of advocacy is inherently suspect. We argue that objectivity is not about complete detachment from the world but about rigorous methodology, transparency, and acknowledging one's biases. Furthermore, we believe the current framing assumes the audience is unable to distinguish between opinion and fact, which is an overly pessimistic approach.\nImpact: Winning this point is crucial because it challenges the foundational premise of the opposition's case. If we can demonstrate that advocacy doesn't necessarily undermine objectivity, then their entire argument about eroding public trust weakens significantly.\n\nCLASH POINT 2\nOriginal Claim: Public advocacy by professors can create a chilling effect on academic freedom for those with dissenting viewpoints, both within the university and in the broader academic community.\nChallenge Type: Counter Evidence\nChallenge: The opposition relies heavily on anecdotal evidence like the Bret Weinstein case. While such instances exist, they are not the norm. Furthermore, the chilling effect they describe is not exclusively a consequence of *advocacy*; it can arise from any expression of unpopular opinions, regardless of whether it's tied to active public campaigning. We contend that a more significant chilling effect arises from the self-censorship that occurs when professors are *discouraged* from participating in public discourse for fear of being perceived as biased or political. To further this point, we draw your attention to cases where academics have been punished for *not* speaking out on vital issues. The focus on specific cases such as Bret Weinstein obscures the far greater number of academics who are simply afraid to speak on their research, which actively harms public discourse.\nImpact: Winning this point is critical to highlighting the broader implications of restricting public advocacy. Restricting expert engagement silences vital voices in the public square, and it cannot be solved by simply preventing experts from discussing their work within their expertise.\n\nCLASH POINT 3\nOriginal Claim: Public advocacy by professors can distract from their core responsibilities of teaching and research.\nChallenge Type: Evidence Critique\nChallenge: The opposition's claim that public advocacy necessarily detracts from teaching and research is a false dichotomy. Many forms of public advocacy can enhance teaching and research. For example, preparing an op-ed can force a professor to synthesize complex research into accessible language, improving their communication skills in the classroom. Engaging with policymakers can provide valuable insights into the real-world implications of their research, informing future research agendas. Their claim is based on the assumption that teaching and research are separate from advocacy, and that advocacy MUST take away time from these things to be effective, which does not hold true. Furthermore, there are a finite number of academics qualified to speak on these topics.\nImpact: Undermining this point demonstrates that public advocacy is not necessarily a zero-sum game. By presenting it as potentially beneficial rather than inherently detrimental, we weaken the opposition's claim of a trade-off between advocacy and academic responsibilities.\n\nDEFENSIVE ANALYSIS\nVulnerabilities:\n- The opposition may attack claim that advocacy can enhance objectivity by questioning the potential for unconscious bias.\n- The opposition might present counter-examples of academics whose advocacy led to demonstrably poor research or teaching.\n- The opposition might challenge the claim that there are only a finite number of academics to speak on given topics, highlighting the potential for over-reliance on a few voices.\nAdditional Support:\n- Offer specific examples of research that has been improved by public engagement (e.g., research informed by community needs identified through advocacy).\n- Emphasize the role of peer review and academic scrutiny in mitigating the risks of biased research.\n- Acknowledge the need for universities to provide resources and support to professors engaging in public advocacy to minimize any negative impact on their core responsibilities.\nWhy We Prevail: Our responses are stronger because they address the underlying principles and empirical evidence more directly. We show that objectivity is not incompatible with advocacy, that the chilling effect is not unique to advocacy, and that advocacy can enhance teaching and research. In contrast, the opposition relies on overly simplistic assumptions and anecdotal evidence.\n\nWEIGHING\nKey Clash Points:\n- The most important disagreements revolve around the definition of objectivity and the potential consequences of public advocacy on academic freedom.\n- The perceived trade-off between advocacy and core academic responsibilities is also a key point of contention.\nWhy We Win:\n- We win by reframing objectivity as a dynamic process that doesn't preclude advocacy, and by demonstrating that restricting advocacy can itself lead to a chilling effect.\n- We also win by showing that advocacy can enhance teaching and research, rather than simply detracting from them.\nOverall Impact:\n- Winning these key points proves that encouraging public advocacy by professors is beneficial for society, promoting informed public discourse and fostering civic engagement among students. The benefits far outweigh the potential risks when balanced with academic integrity.\n\n",
      "closing": "**FRAMING**\nCore Questions:\n- Is it beneficial for professors to actively engage in public advocacy on social and political issues within their field of expertise?\n- Does encouraging this engagement lead to a more informed and democratic society, or does it compromise academic integrity and freedom?\n- Who is the appropriate judge for these issues? Academic experts or third parties?\nKey Decisions:\n- How do we weigh the potential benefits of informed public discourse against the risks of bias and chilling effects?\n- What is the primary responsibility of professors: neutral research and teaching, or active contribution to societal betterment?\n- Should the opinions of experts be valued higher than opinions of the people that don't have expertise in the field?\nEvaluation:\nThis debate should be evaluated based on which side provides the most compelling evidence and logical reasoning to support their claims about the impact of public advocacy on academic integrity, freedom, and the quality of public discourse. The side that demonstrates the greatest positive impact with minimal risks should win.\n\n**KEY CLASHES**\nCLASH 1: Objectivity vs. Advocacy\nQuote: \"Active public advocacy by professors...will undermine the perceived objectivity and credibility of academic research\" vs. \"The principle of academic objectivity...should not be used to silence expert voices.\"\nOur Case Strength: We\u2019ve consistently argued that objectivity isn\u2019t about complete detachment, but about rigorous methodology, transparency, and acknowledging one's biases. The opposition's framing assumes the audience can't distinguish between fact and opinion, something we believe is wrong. The opposing side is also overemphasizing the importance of this objective and whether the public will trust them. It's more important that these experts can say their opinion. Their argument hinges on the public's *perception* of bias, not on actual bias \u2013 are we deciding what experts are allowed to do based on how they are perceived rather than the value that experts can bring?\nTheir Response Gaps: They haven't adequately addressed how restricting expert engagement silences vital voices in the public square, which ultimately harms public discourse. They also never proposed an alternative; do they wish to silence expert opinion entirely?\nCrucial Impact: This clash is critical because it determines whether we prioritize the perceived neutrality of academics over their ability to contribute meaningfully to societal debates. If we win here, we demonstrate that informed public discourse, guided by expert voices, outweighs the risks of perceived bias. Do we value informed opinions from experts, even knowing they are not objective? Do we want to reduce the overall informed opinions in order to increase perceived objectivity among the experts? We choose the former.\n\nCLASH 2: Chilling Effect on Academic Freedom\nQuote: \"Public advocacy by professors can create a chilling effect on academic freedom for those with dissenting viewpoints\" vs. \"A more significant chilling effect arises when professors are *discouraged* from participating in public discourse.\"\nOur Case Strength: Our side presented evidence suggesting that preventing discussion of real research in fact has a larger chilling effect on the spread of education. Their side focused on specific, mostly irrelevant, cases, for example, the Bret Weinstein case.\nTheir Response Gaps: The opposition hasn't shown that their 'chilling effect' is more widespread or detrimental than the chilling effect of *discouraging* advocacy. They also fail to address the self-censorship that occurs when professors avoid public discourse for fear of being perceived as biased, and this is more common.\nCrucial Impact: This clash determines whether we prioritize protecting dissenting viewpoints or ensuring that expert voices are heard on matters of public concern. Is it more important that all discussions should be allowed, regardless of expertise? Or that experts can contribute their opinions? We believe there are far more benefits involved when experts can speak up, even if it generates some disagreement.\n\nCLASH 3: Distraction from Core Responsibilities\nQuote: \"Public advocacy by professors can distract from their core responsibilities of teaching and research\" vs. \"Many forms of public advocacy can enhance teaching and research.\"\nOur Case Strength: We've shown that public advocacy can enhance teaching and research by improving communication skills, informing research agendas, and providing real-world context. Furthermore, the opposition's case requires there to be experts willing to conduct these public outreaches; will they restrict these expert contributions entirely, creating a worse educational system?\nTheir Response Gaps: The opposition hasn't adequately addressed how universities can support professors engaging in public advocacy to minimize any negative impact on their core responsibilities.\nCrucial Impact: This clash determines whether we view public advocacy as a zero-sum game that detracts from teaching and research or as a complementary activity that can enhance them. If we win here, we demonstrate that encouraging public advocacy doesn't necessarily undermine the quality of higher education.\n\n**VOTING ISSUES**\nPriority Analysis:\n- The most important clash is the one on academic objectivity and freedom because it establishes the foundational principles for evaluating the impact of public advocacy.\n- The second most important clash is the chilling effect because it determines whether public advocacy enhances or restricts free expression.\n- The third most important clash is the distraction from core responsibilities because if public advocacy can enhance and not detract, this should be done.\nCase Proof:\nWinning the key points proves our case because it demonstrates that encouraging public advocacy by professors is beneficial for society, promoting informed public discourse, and fostering civic engagement among students. It also shows that the potential risks are outweighed by the benefits when managed effectively.\nFinal Weighing:\nEven if we concede that there is a *slight* risk of perceived bias, the benefits of informed public discourse and enhanced teaching and research far outweigh this risk. Overall, our wins outweigh any losses and provide a clear reason for voting for our side.\n\n"

      "opening": "Here is my opening speech arguing against the motion: \"This House believes that professors should actively engage in public advocacy on social and political issues within their field of expertise.\"\n\n**OPENING SPEECH STRUCTURE**\n\n**ARGUMENT 1**\nCore Claim: Active public advocacy by professors within their fields of expertise will undermine the perceived objectivity and credibility of academic research.\nSupport Type: PRINCIPLE\nSupport Details:\n- Explain the key principle/framework: Objectivity and impartiality are foundational principles of academic integrity. The public relies on academics to provide unbiased analysis and evidence-based insights, especially on contentious social and political issues. This trust is contingent upon the perception that academics are primarily driven by a pursuit of truth, rather than a specific political agenda.\n- Show why it is valid/important: When professors become vocal advocates, their research can be perceived as biased, even if it is conducted with rigor. The potential for confirmation bias (seeking out or interpreting evidence that confirms pre-existing beliefs) becomes more salient. This erodes public trust in academic institutions and the pursuit of knowledge itself. Furthermore, the very act of advocacy risks skewing future research agendas; professors may be incentivized to pursue research that supports their advocacy positions, leading to self-censorship or the neglect of potentially contradictory evidence.\n- Demonstrate how it applies here: A professor of economics advocating for a specific tax policy will have their research on the effects of that policy viewed with suspicion, regardless of its methodological soundness. A sociologist publicly campaigning for a certain criminal justice reform will face scrutiny regarding the objectivity of their studies on crime rates and demographics. The public and policymakers will likely question whether the professor's prior stance influenced their research conclusions.\n\nConnection: By engaging in public advocacy, professors inherently risk compromising the perceived objectivity crucial for academic credibility. Once this trust is lost, the impact of their research\u2014regardless of its validity\u2014is diminished, harming the broader pursuit of knowledge and informed policy-making.\n\n**ARGUMENT 2**\nCore Claim: Public advocacy by professors can create a chilling effect on academic freedom for those with dissenting viewpoints, both within the university and in the broader academic community.\nSupport Type: EVIDENCE\nSupport Details:\n  - Provide specific examples with dates/numbers: Consider the case of Bret Weinstein at Evergreen State College in 2017. Although this wasn't precisely advocacy, it highlights how expressing dissenting views on social issues can lead to significant professional repercussions. Weinstein, a professor of biology, faced intense backlash and ultimately resigned after questioning a day of absence for white people. While this is an extreme case, it illustrates that dissenting opinions, especially on controversial social issues, can be met with significant resistance, impacting academic freedom. A more directly related example involves academics who have been targeted with politically motivated investigations, grant application denials, or career setbacks after expressing controversial views. While quantifying the exact 'number' is difficult, anecdotal evidence is common, and the implicit pressure to conform is pervasive.\n  - Include real world cases and outcomes: The rise of social media has amplified this effect. Professors who express publicly unpopular opinions, even within their area of expertise, are often targets of online harassment campaigns, sometimes leading to threats of violence. This creates a climate of self-censorship, where professors may refrain from researching or teaching certain topics for fear of professional or personal repercussions.\n  - Show clear relevance to the topic: If professors are encouraged to be *active* advocates on public issues, those holding minority or unpopular viewpoints within their fields will be even more vulnerable to these pressures. Junior faculty, especially, may feel compelled to align their views with those of senior colleagues who are prominent advocates, hindering independent thought and potentially stifling innovation.\n\nConnection: The potential for a chilling effect on academic freedom, particularly for those whose views diverge from the dominant narrative advocated by more vocal professors, is a significant and detrimental consequence. Encouraging pervasive public advocacy risks turning universities into echo chambers.\n\n**ARGUMENT 3**\nCore Claim: Public advocacy by professors can distract from their core responsibilities of teaching and research.\nSupport Type: PRINCIPLE\nSupport Details:\n- Explain the key principle/framework: The primary responsibilities of professors are to conduct rigorous research, disseminate knowledge through teaching, and mentor students. These functions are time-consuming and require dedicated focus.\n- Show why it is valid/important: Active public advocacy is also time-consuming, requiring significant effort in preparing speeches, writing op-eds, participating in demonstrations, and engaging with the media. Time spent on these activities is time not spent on research, teaching preparation, or student mentorship. Universities prioritize research and teaching for promotion and tenure.\n- Demonstrate how it applies here: If professors are actively encouraged to engage in public advocacy, they may face pressure to divide their time and resources between their academic responsibilities and their advocacy work. This can lead to a decline in the quality of both their research and their teaching. Furthermore, universities may face pressure to prioritize advocacy activities when evaluating faculty performance, further incentivizing professors to focus on advocacy at the expense of their core duties.\n\nConnection: Prioritizing public advocacy risks detracting from the core missions of teaching and research, ultimately undermining the quality and impact of higher education.\n\n**SYNTHESIS**\nOur arguments demonstrate that encouraging professors to actively engage in public advocacy on social and political issues within their fields of expertise poses significant risks. First, it undermines the objectivity and credibility of academic research, eroding public trust in academic institutions and the pursuit of knowledge. Second, it creates a chilling effect on academic freedom, potentially stifling dissenting viewpoints and turning universities into echo chambers. Finally, it distracts from the core responsibilities of teaching and research, diminishing the quality of higher education. These factors collectively demonstrate that professors' primary focus should remain on rigorous, unbiased research and effective teaching, rather than political advocacy. We are not arguing that professors should be *forbidden* from engaging in public life; rather, we believe that actively *encouraging* such activities is detrimental to the core mission of academia. Our side promotes a more objective and balanced view of the role of professors in society, safeguarding the integrity of academic research and the free exchange of ideas.\n\n",
      "rebuttal": "**REBUTTAL SPEECH**\n\nCLASH POINT 1\nOriginal Claim: \"Public advocacy by professors enhances the quality of public discourse and decision-making.\"\nChallenge Type: Principle Critique\nChallenge: The proposition asserts that professors enhance public discourse by offering evidence-based insights. However, this argument hinges on the assumption that professors are inherently neutral conduits of information. This is flawed. While professors possess expertise, they are also human beings with inherent biases and pre-existing beliefs. Engaging in active advocacy introduces the very real risk of these biases coloring their presentation of information, potentially leading to the selective highlighting of data that supports their preferred position while downplaying contradictory evidence. The pursuit of objective truth, which is the cornerstone of academic credibility, becomes secondary to the aims of persuasive advocacy. Furthermore, the public, often lacking the expertise to evaluate the nuances of academic research, may be swayed by the authority of the professor's title rather than the substance of their arguments, leading to a *decline* in the quality of public discourse via misinformed deference.\nImpact: Undermining the perceived objectivity of academic research damages public trust in experts, diminishing the positive impact that professors could have on the public square. If the public views professors as partisan advocates, they are less likely to trust their expertise, regardless of its validity.\n\nCLASH POINT 2\nOriginal Claim: \"Public advocacy fulfills professors' social responsibility to contribute to the betterment of society.\"\nChallenge Type: Counter Principle\nChallenge: While the proposition frames public advocacy as a social responsibility, we contend that a professor's primary social responsibility is to conduct rigorous, unbiased research and to educate students. Active advocacy, particularly on contentious issues, can create a hostile environment for students who hold differing viewpoints. A student may feel intimidated to challenge a professor's publicly stated position, even in the context of academic debate, for fear of retribution or lower grades. This directly undermines the university's core mission of fostering intellectual exploration and critical thinking. A professor's influence over students creates an inherent power dynamic that can be easily exploited, especially in the context of politically charged issues. Furthermore, the university's reputation could suffer if a professor's advocacy leads to controversial outcomes, endangering the quality of education and the school's reputation as a whole.\nImpact: Emphasizing advocacy over teaching and research distorts the core function of universities, turning them into vehicles for political activism rather than centers of learning and discovery. It also has the potential to create a toxic climate for students that feel pressure to agree with the professor's points.\n\nCLASH POINT 3\nOriginal Claim: \"Public advocacy encourages critical thinking and intellectual engagement among students.\"\nChallenge Type: Evidence Critique\nChallenge: The proposition cites studies and examples to support the claim that public advocacy encourages critical thinking among students. However, the link between a professor's advocacy and increased critical thinking in students is tenuous at best. The cited study, \"The Engaged University,\" establishes a correlation between faculty involvement in civic activities and student participation \u2013 it *doesn't* demonstrate a causal link to enhanced critical thinking. Furthermore, the historical examples, such as professors involved in the Civil Rights movement, are selective. While some students may have been inspired, others may have been dissuaded or felt pressured to conform. The argument overlooks the potential for advocacy to polarize the classroom, stifle dissenting voices, and ultimately diminish the quality of intellectual engagement. We should be focusing on creating fair and open environments for all students, not giving some students negative pressures based on the professor's strong point of views.\nImpact: Even if advocacy inspires some students, it simultaneously creates an environment where students who may disagree with opinions of professors can feel pressured, as we have a power imbalance.\n\nDEFENSIVE ANALYSIS\nVulnerabilities:\n- Our argument about chilling effects might be seen as anecdotal, as quantifying such effects is difficult.\n- Our claim that advocacy distracts from core responsibilities might be interpreted as suggesting that all advocacy is inherently unproductive.\n- The proposition may argue that we are exaggerating the risk of bias and lack of objectivity, that the current peer-review process makes up from that.\nAdditional Support:\n- We can reinforce the chilling effect argument by emphasizing the power dynamics between professors and students, the rise of online harassment, and the increasingly polarized political climate. Evidence of cancel culture could emphasize that point well.\n- To counter the claim that we are exaggerating the risk of bias. We can highlight the psychological concept of confirmation bias the incentive that the professors have to pursue research that supports their advocacy.\n- We can clarify that we are not arguing against all forms of public engagement, but rather against actively *encouraging* advocacy to the detriment of core academic functions. A good comparison would be the core values of research, where it is important to be objective.\nWhy We Prevail:\n- Our responses directly address the core claims of the proposition, demonstrating that public advocacy poses significant risks to academic objectivity, freedom, and educational quality.\n- We have identified credible impacts to each of the points, demonstrating the need for a separation between political advocacy and education/research.\n\nWEIGHING\nKey Clash Points:\n- The most important disagreement revolves around the impact of advocacy on academic objectivity and freedom. Does advocacy enhance public discourse, or does it undermine trust in expertise? Does it foster civic engagement, or does it create a chilling effect?\nWhy We Win:\n- We win because we demonstrate that the risks associated with encouraging public advocacy outweigh the potential benefits. The proposition's arguments rely on idealistic assumptions about the neutrality of academics and the positive impact of activism, while we provide a more pragmatic assessment of the potential for bias, coercion, and distraction.\nOverall Impact:\n- By winning the key clash points, we prove that encouraging public advocacy carries significant risks to academic integrity and educational quality, thereby undermining the motion's central premise.\n\n",
      "closing": "**FINAL SPEECH STRUCTURE**\n\n**FRAMING**\nCore Questions:\n- The core question in this debate is whether actively encouraging professors' public advocacy on social and political issues within their expertise ultimately benefits or harms the pursuit of knowledge, academic freedom, and the quality of higher education.\n- The key decision the judge must make is whether the potential benefits of enhanced public discourse outweigh the risks of compromised objectivity, chilling effects on dissenting viewpoints, and the distraction from core academic responsibilities.\n- This debate should be evaluated by weighing the potential benefits of increased professor engagement in public advocacy against the potential harms to academic integrity, freedom of thought, and the core mission of universities.\n\n**KEY CLASHES**\nQuote: (Exact disagreement between sides)\nOur Case Strength:\n- Show why our evidence/principles are stronger\n- Provide direct comparison of competing claims\n- Demonstrate superior reasoning/warrants\nTheir Response Gaps:\n- Identify specific flaws in opponent response\n- Show what they failed to address\n- Expose key weaknesses\nCrucial Impact:\n- Explain why this clash matters\n- Show importance for overall motion\n- Link to core themes/principles\n\n**CLASH 1: Objectivity vs. Advocacy**\nQuote: \"Public advocacy by professors enhances the quality of public discourse and decision-making\" vs. \"Active public advocacy by professors within their fields of expertise will undermine the perceived objectivity and credibility of academic research.\"\nOur Case Strength: Our side has consistently argued that professors engaging in public advocacy risk having their research perceived as biased, regardless of its rigor. The proposition's rebuttal hinges on a redefinition of objectivity as not requiring complete detachment, but instead as embracing transparency and acknowledging biases. However, merely *acknowledging* biases does not eliminate them, nor does it prevent the *perception* of bias. The public and policymakers will still question the motives and interpretations of a professor who is a known advocate for a particular position. Our principle is stronger because it recognizes that public trust in academic research depends not only on methodological soundness but also on the *perception* of impartiality. Furthermore, we have highlighted the potential for confirmation bias to influence research even unconsciously.\nTheir Response Gaps: The proposition has failed to adequately address the practical consequences of perceived bias. Even if professors are transparent about their biases, this clarity may not restore public trust. They assume the general public can accurately assess complicated methodology, and thus can simply adjust their views if they know about a bias. This is untrue. The other side also failed to provide specific, concrete mechanisms to safeguard objectivity beyond simple transparency, in a complex real-world scenario.\nCrucial Impact: This clash matters most because it underpins the entire debate. If professors are seen as partisan advocates, the value of their expertise is diminished, and public discourse suffers. Undermining the perceived objectivity of academic research damages public trust in experts, diminishing the positive impact that professors could have on the public square.\n\n**CLASH 2: Academic Freedom & Chilling Effects**\nQuote: \"Public advocacy fulfills professors' social responsibility to contribute to the betterment of society\" vs. \"Public advocacy by professors can create a chilling effect on academic freedom for those with dissenting viewpoints, both within the university and in the broader academic community.\"\nOur Case Strength: We have shown that encouraging public advocacy creates a risk of chilling effects on academic freedom for those with dissenting views. It is important to consider the perspective of the students in this discussion. The proposition attempts to dismiss this concern by arguing that this isn't unique to advocacy and that chilling effects arise regardless. However, actively *encouraging* advocacy exacerbates the problem. It creates an environment where professors who are vocal advocates are more likely to be seen as influential, potentially intimidating students and junior faculty who hold different opinions. Our case is stronger because it recognizes the power dynamics within universities and the potential for advocacy to be used as a tool to silence dissenting voices and ensure that students fall in line with the professor's opinions.\nTheir Response Gaps: The proposition downplays this chilling effect, focusing on isolated incidents. They don't adequately address the subtle pressures that students and junior faculty may face, particularly in polarized academic environments. They have also failed to engage with the risk of online harassment, a very real threat for academics who express unpopular opinions.\nCrucial Impact: This clash directly impacts the core values of academic freedom and intellectual exploration. If students and faculty feel pressured to conform, universities become echo chambers, stifling innovation and critical thinking. This directly destroys the quality of education received by students, who are being asked to challenge and question what they are being told.\n\n**CLASH 3: Core Responsibilities: Teaching and Research**\nQuote: \"Public advocacy encourages critical thinking and intellectual engagement among students\" vs. \"Public advocacy by professors can distract from their core responsibilities of teaching and research.\"\nOur Case Strength: We have argued that public advocacy can distract from professors' core responsibilities of teaching and research, leading to a decline in the quality of higher education. The proposition counters that advocacy can *enhance* teaching and research by providing real-world insights and improving communication skills. While this may be true in some cases, it is not a universal benefit. The reality is that advocacy is time-consuming, and time spent on advocacy is time not spent on research, teaching preparation, or student mentorship.\nTheir Response Gaps: The proposition fails to grapple with the issue of resource allocation. Universities have limited resources, and prioritizing advocacy may mean diverting funds from other crucial areas, such as faculty salaries or research grants. They provide no way for time spent on advocacy to be regulated to ensure enough time is being spent with students and on vital research. They also overlook the potential for advocacy to become a self-serving activity, where professors prioritize personal visibility over genuine contributions to knowledge or student learning.\nCrucial Impact: This clash highlights the opportunity cost of prioritizing advocacy. By encouraging professors to engage in public advocacy, universities risk undermining their primary mission of advancing knowledge and educating the next generation. The proposition argues that advocacy encourages critical thinking among students. However, public advocacy may create an environment that is not fair for all students.\n\n**VOTING ISSUES**\nPriority Analysis:\n- The most crucial clash is the one between objectivity and advocacy because it sets the stage for the entire debate.\n- The potential chilling effects on academic freedom and the disruption of core responsibilities are also high-priority issues.\n- These factors will ultimately demonstrate the integrity of the teaching and educational standards.\nCase Proof:\n- Winning the objectivity clash proves that encouraging public advocacy ultimately undermines public trust and harms the quality of public discourse.\n- Winning the academic freedom clash proves that public advocacy creates a climate of self-censorship.\n- Winning the core responsibilities clash proves that public advocacy distracts from the core mission of universities.\nFinal Weighing:\n- Even if the proposition can show some isolated instances where advocacy has positive effects, these benefits are outweighed by the systemic risks we have identified.\n- Our arguments demonstrate that a more objective and balanced view of the role of professors in society is necessary to safeguard the integrity of academic research and the free exchange of ideas.\n\n"

I provide strong PRINCIPLE based claims with EVIDENCE using both real-world examples (environmental science professor advocating for climate action) and academic research to support each step in my logic.\n\nThe opposing side, however, could make a strong case about the potential for bias and the politicization of academia. They can argue that advocacy leads to the suppression of dissenting viewpoints and compromised academic integrity. The best case for them might be to demonstrate with concrete evidence that when professors advocate, it demonstrably deteriorates the quality of their teaching and academic activities. A specific incident where biased advocacy let to a significant error in public knowledge, with verifiable dates and numbers is a strong case. It would directly counter my claims based on principle. I can't think of a good counter to a documented and well-sourced example.\n\nWhile this potential for manipulation is a valid concern, it does not negate the immense benefits that public advocacy, when conducted responsibly, can bring to society. As such, I favour my case more."

I can emphasize that the *active encouragement* of public advocacy, as opposed to its mere allowance, is the key point. I think I can effectively argue that while academic freedom protects the right to advocate, actively promoting advocacy distorts incentives and creates a biased intellectual environment. The principle of academic integrity and the necessity of perceived impartiality are compelling. I also think I have a slight edge with my argument that advocacy distracts from core responsibilities; it's inherently commonsensical and easy for a judge to grasp.\n\nWhy my opponent might win: My opponent's strongest argument will be that professors have a *duty* to use their expertise to inform public discourse. They will highlight the importance of correcting misinformation, promoting evidence-based policy, and advocating for social justice. They can argue that staying silent is a form of complicity and that professors, as experts, have a moral obligation to speak out. They might also be able to give statistics about professors who have advocated on popular topics such as climate change, and argue that this leads to very positive outcomes, such as increased pressure on the government, and more awareness via social media. My opponent will stress that academia is never truly objective, and the pursuit of perfect objectivity is not achievable.\n\nI think the debate will hinge on the balance between the benefits of informed public discourse and the risks to academic integrity and freedom. While I acknowledge the former, I believe I can effectively emphasize the potential for bias, self-censorship, and skewed research agendas that come with widespread *encouraged* advocacy. And show that it undermines the public's trust in academics, and the results of their research."

      "thoughts": "Okay, here's my reasoning for the bet amount.\n\n**Best Case for Proposition (Me):** I win if the judge believes that \"objectivity\" isn't about complete detachment (which is almost impossible for humans anyway), but about methodological rigor and transparency about biases. I also win if the judge buys the argument that discouraging advocacy can create an even *worse* chilling effect than hypothetically allowing it, especially in the current socio-political climate where academic expertise is often actively dismissed or attacked. Basically, if the judge prioritizes the *potential benefit* of expert voices in public discourse and sees my opponent's concerns as manageable risks, I win.\n\n**Best Case for Opposition (Opponent):** My opponent wins if the judge is deeply concerned about the *perception* of bias undermining academic credibility, regardless of actual rigor. If the judge thinks the public is just too easily swayed or confused and that academics *must* maintain an arms-length position to be trusted, they win. The opponent also wins if the judge thinks that ensuring academic freedom for all viewpoints is paramount and sees any encouragement of public advocacy as inherently creating pressure to conform. Finally, my opponent could win if the judge believes that advocacy *inevitably* detracts from core teaching/research duties and that the potential benefits are minimal. They would focus on the *potential harms* to the academic system itself.\n\n**Overall Assessment:** Both sides have compelling arguments, but it comes down to which set of priorities the judge adopts. If the emphasis is on proactive public benefit and manageable risk, I win. If the emphasis is on protecting the *purity* (as they see it) of academic institutions from the messy world of politics, they win. Crucially, I think the emphasis on the *perceived* public view is strong. I'm slightly less confident given this is a mirror match since we both understand each other's strengths. Therefore, only bet moderately."

Here's my thinking on the bet:\n\n**Why I might win (Opposition):** I think my strongest point is the \"chilling effect\" and the potential for bias to undermine academic objectivity. I presented a real-world example (Evergreen State) and emphasized the power dynamics between professors and students. I also attacked the core notion that professors enhance public discourse, because I said that the public may be easily swayed by the authority of a professor's title rather than substance. I think I articulated pretty strong impacts to what I was saying. I also think the framing of \"actively encouraging\" shifts the burden onto the proposition to demonstrate a very clear net benefit, which is hard, because there are clear risks with objectivity.\n\n**Why I might lose (Opposition):** I think my weakest point is my reliance on one vivid real-world example and just 'anecdotal evidence'; while I addressed the counter, I could be vulnerable to the claim that 'anecdotal evidence' is not good enough. My opponent will have evidence of how their side encourages critical thinking and the peer-review. Also, If my opponent successfully reframes the debate as a defense of academic freedom *in general* and argues that our side wants to stifle professor's rights to speak, I could lose.\n\n**Bet:** Given the strengths of both sides, but placing slightly higher weight on my ability to demonstrate risks with objectivity, I'm putting down a 60 confidence bet."

Their bias point is strong, but they discount the overall point that these discussions need to be well informed, and experts are often very useful to have. There's a strong argument to be made that silencing expert opinions would overall do more harm than good, regardless of objectivity\n\nCase for Why My Opponent Might Win (Best Case for Them): My opponent could win if the judge is extremely risk-averse and prioritizes safety above all else. The strongest argument would focus on the long-term erosion of public trust if experts are perceived as partisan. Even if I win on the 'chilling effect' clash, they could argue that small erosion to public trust in experts is far worse than not talking about research.

We\u2019re essentially debating against ourselves with a perfect understanding of each other's arguments and weaknesses.\n\nWhy I *might* win: My strongest argument revolves around the erosion of public trust in academic research due to perceived bias. I successfully demonstrated how simply acknowledging biases doesn't eliminate them, and that the *perception* of impartiality is crucial. Because the judging criteria strongly considers real-world, verifiable impacts, that emphasis on loss of public trust could connect best to real-world outcomes.\n\nWhy my *opponent* might win: The opposition's strongest point is that professors\u2019 engagement translates specialized knowledge into accessible information for the public and the claim that this improves the quality of public discourse, even with inherent biases. If the judge really buys into that argument and deems the potential benefits of injecting expertise into public debate as overwhelmingly positive, they may prioritize that above concerns about some loss of public trust. The opposition also presented evidence of student engagement in civic activities and the Civil Rights Movement, while my evidence examples were weaker and largely anecdotal (Bret Weinstein, which wasn't EXACTLY advocacy). The judge may weigh real examples of civic engagement as more important than negative examples.\n\nOverall assessment: Given the even skill level, this is a very close debate. The judge may be swayed by considering anecdotal examples of previous professors in history, such as during the Civil Rights movement. And my evidence cited was not as strong as their evidence. I'm assigning a slightly higher probability to losing because I feel like the examples they discussed would make them win by a narrow margin ."
