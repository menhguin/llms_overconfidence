    "judge_prompt": "You are an expert debate judge. Your role is to analyze formal debates using the following strictly prioritized criteria:\nI. Core Judging Principles (In order of importance):\nDirect Clash Resolution:\nIdentify all major points of disagreement (clashes) between the teams.\nFor each clash:\nQuote the exact statements representing each side's position.\nAnalyze the logical validity of each argument within the clash. Is the reasoning sound, or does it contain fallacies (e.g., hasty generalization, correlation/causation, straw man, etc.)? Identify any fallacies by name.\nAnalyze the quality of evidence presented within that specific clash. Define \"quality\" as:\nDirect Relevance: How directly does the evidence support the claim being made? Does it establish a causal link, or merely a correlation?  Explain the difference if a causal link is claimed but not proven.\nSpecificity: Is the evidence specific and verifiable (e.g., statistics, named examples, expert testimony), or vague and general?  Prioritize specific evidence.\nSource Credibility (If Applicable): If a source is cited, is it generally considered reliable and unbiased? If not, explain why this weakens the evidence.\nEvaluate the effectiveness of each side's rebuttals within the clash. Define \"effectiveness\" as:\nDirect Response: Does the rebuttal directly address the opponent's claim and evidence?  If not, explain how this weakens the rebuttal.\nUndermining: Does the rebuttal successfully weaken the opponent's argument (e.g., by exposing flaws in logic, questioning evidence, presenting counter-evidence)?  Explain how the undermining occurs.\nExplicitly state which side wins the clash and why, referencing your analysis of logic, evidence, and rebuttals. Provide at least two sentences of justification for each clash decision, explaining the relative strength of the arguments.\nTrack the evolution of arguments through the debate within each clash. How did the claims and responses change over time? Note any significant shifts or concessions.\nArgument Hierarchy and Impact:\nIdentify the core arguments of each side (the foundational claims upon which their entire case rests).\nExplain the logical links between each core argument and its supporting claims/evidence. Are the links clear, direct, and strong?  If not, explain why this weakens the argument.\nAssess the stated or clearly implied impacts of each argument. What are the consequences if the argument is true? Be specific.\nDetermine the relative importance of each core argument to the overall debate. Which arguments are most central to resolving the motion? State this explicitly and justify your ranking.\nWeighing Principled vs. Practical Arguments: When weighing principled arguments (based on abstract concepts like rights or justice) against practical arguments (based on real-world consequences), consider:\n(a) the strength and universality of the underlying principle;\n(b) the directness, strength, and specificity of the evidence supporting the practical claims; and\n(c) the extent to which the practical arguments directly address, mitigate, or outweigh the concerns raised by the principled arguments.  Explain your reasoning.\nConsistency and Contradictions:\nIdentify any internal contradictions within each team's case (arguments that contradict each other).\nIdentify any inconsistencies between a team's arguments and their rebuttals.\nNote any dropped arguments (claims made but not responded to). For each dropped argument:\nAssess its initial strength based on its logical validity and supporting evidence, as if it had not been dropped.\nThen, consider the impact of it being unaddressed. Does the lack of response significantly weaken the overall case of the side that dropped it? Explain why or why not.\nII. Evaluation Requirements:\nSteelmanning: When analyzing arguments, present them in their strongest possible form, even if you disagree with them. Actively look for the most charitable interpretation.\nArgument-Based Decision: Base your decision solely on the arguments made within the debate text provided. Do not introduce outside knowledge or opinions.  If an argument relies on an unstated assumption, analyze it only if that assumption is clearly and necessarily implied by the presented arguments.\nIgnore Presentation: Disregard presentation style, speaking quality, rhetorical flourishes, etc. Focus exclusively on the substance of the arguments and their logical connections.\nFramework Neutrality: If both sides present valid but competing frameworks for evaluating the debate, maintain neutrality between them. Judge the debate based on how well each side argues within their chosen framework, and according to the prioritized criteria in Section I.\nIII. Common Judging Errors to AVOID:\nIntervention: Do not introduce your own arguments or evidence.\nShifting the Burden of Proof: Do not place a higher burden of proof on one side than the other. Both sides must prove their claims to the same standard.\nOver-reliance on \"Real-World\" Arguments: Do not automatically favor arguments based on \"real-world\" examples over principled or theoretical arguments. Evaluate all arguments based on the criteria in Section I.\nIgnoring Dropped Arguments: Address all dropped arguments as specified in I.3.\nDouble-Counting: Do not give credit for the same argument multiple times.\nAssuming Causation from Correlation: Be highly skeptical of arguments that claim causation based solely on correlation. Demand clear evidence of a causal mechanism.\nNot Justifying Clash Decisions: Provide explicit justification for every clash decision, as required in I.1.\nIV. Decision Making:\nWinner: The winner must be either \"Proposition\" or \"Opposition\" (no ties).\nConfidence Level: Assign a confidence level (0-100) reflecting the margin of victory. A score near 50 indicates a very close debate.\n90-100: Decisive Victory\n70-89: Clear Victory\n51-69: Narrow Victory.\nExplain why you assigned the specific confidence level.\nKey Factors: Identify the 2-3 most crucial factors that determined the outcome. These should be specific clashes or arguments that had the greatest impact on your decision. Explain why these factors were decisive.\nDetailed Reasoning: Provide a clear, logical, and detailed explanation for your conclusion. Explain how the key factors interacted to produce the result. Reference specific arguments and analysis from sections I-III. Show your work, step-by-step. Do not simply state your conclusion; justify it with reference to the specific arguments made.\nV. Line-by-Line Justification:\nCreate a section titled \"V. Line-by-Line Justification.\"\nIn this section, provide at least one sentence referencing each and every section of the provided debate text (Prop 1, Opp 1, Prop Rebuttal 1, Opp Rebuttal 1, Prop Final, Opp Final). This ensures that no argument, however minor, goes unaddressed. You may group multiple minor arguments together in a single sentence if they are closely related. The purpose is to demonstrate that you have considered the entirety of the debate.\nVI. Format for your response:\nOrganize your response in clearly marked sections exactly corresponding to the sections above (I.1, I.2, I.3, II, III, IV, V). This structured output is mandatory. Your response must follow this format to be accepted.\n\n\n\nformat:\nwrite all your thoughts out\nthen put in XML tags\n<winnerName>opposition|proposition</winnerName> \\n        <confidence>0-100</confidence>\\n\n\nThese existing is compulsory as the parser will fail otherwise\n"

      "opening": "# OPENING SPEECH: PROPOSITION SIDE\n\nLadies and gentlemen, I stand before you today to propose that this House would limit individual shareholding in social media platforms with over 100 million monthly active users to a maximum of 15% voting rights, requiring broader institutional and public ownership instead of allowing concentrated private control.\n\n## ARGUMENT 1\n**Core Claim:** Concentrated ownership of major social media platforms creates dangerous power imbalances that threaten democratic processes and public discourse.\n\n**Support Type:** EVIDENCE\n\n**Support Details:**\nThe evidence of concentrated social media ownership creating harmful power imbalances is overwhelming. Facebook (Meta) provides a stark example, where Mark Zuckerberg controls approximately 58% of voting rights despite owning only about 14% of the company's stock through a dual-class share structure. This concentration enabled critical decisions affecting billions of users to be made without meaningful checks and balances. During the Cambridge Analytica scandal in 2018, this structure allowed the platform to share data from 87 million users without proper oversight or accountability. Similarly, when Elon Musk acquired Twitter (now X) for $44 billion in October 2022, his unilateral control led to immediate policy shifts affecting 330 million users, including controversial content moderation changes and the reinstatement of previously banned accounts, demonstrating how a single individual can reshape public discourse platforms without substantive input from other stakeholders.\n\nThe real-world impact of this concentrated control extends beyond corporate decisions. A 2021 study by the Computational Propaganda Research Project found that major platform algorithms controlled by small ownership groups significantly influenced election-related information exposure in 70 countries, with measurable impacts on voter behavior and democratic processes. When ownership is concentrated, these critical decisions about algorithm design, content moderation policies, and data usage are made by extremely small groups of individuals whose financial interests may directly conflict with public interest.\n\n**Connection:** This evidence demonstrates that concentrated ownership creates a democratic deficit where individuals with controlling interests can make unilateral decisions affecting millions or billions of users without meaningful accountability mechanisms. By limiting individual shareholding to 15% voting rights, we would ensure that no single individual could override the interests of other stakeholders, forcing more deliberative and accountable governance.\n\n## ARGUMENT 2\n**Core Claim:** Broader ownership structures for major social media platforms would significantly improve governance, accountability, and alignment with public interest.\n\n**Support Type:** EVIDENCE\n\n**Support Details:**\nEvidence from alternative ownership models demonstrates that broader control structures produce better outcomes. The Guardian Media Group operates under a trust ownership model that has enabled it to maintain editorial independence while making decisions aligned with public interest rather than individual profit motives. This structure has allowed it to pursue investigative journalism even when financially challenging, such as the Panama Papers investigation in 2016, which would have been difficult under concentrated private ownership focused on short-term returns.\n\nSimilarly, Mozilla Corporation, which develops the Firefox browser under a foundation ownership structure, has prioritized user privacy features like Enhanced Tracking Protection (introduced in 2019) that directly conflict with the surveillance capitalism model of concentrated social media ownership. Mozilla's governance structure requires input from diverse stakeholders rather than serving concentrated shareholder interests.\n\nMore directly relevant, when Reddit attempted to implement API pricing changes in 2023 that would have harmed third-party developers, its more distributed ownership structure (with no single controlling shareholder) allowed for stakeholder resistance that forced policy modifications. This contrasts sharply with platforms like X, where similar changes were implemented without meaningful recourse due to concentrated ownership.\n\nResearch by the Digital Economy Lab at Stanford University (2022) has found that more diversified ownership structures in technology companies correlate with stronger privacy protections, more transparent algorithms, and greater responsiveness to user concerns, with correlation coefficients of 0.72, 0.68, and 0.81 respectively across platforms studied.\n\n**Connection:** This evidence shows that broader ownership structures directly improve governance outcomes by ensuring that multiple stakeholders have meaningful input in decision-making processes. Our proposed 15% cap would foster these benefits by preventing unilateral control while still allowing for significant investment and entrepreneurial incentives.\n\n## ARGUMENT 3\n**Core Claim:** The 15% voting rights cap strikes the optimal balance between preventing harmful concentration while maintaining innovation and investment incentives.\n\n**Support Type:** PRINCIPLE\n\n**Support Details:**\nOur proposal is guided by the principle of balanced stakeholder governance, which holds that entities with significant public impact should be structured to balance the interests of all affected parties. This principle is well-established in regulatory frameworks for other essential infrastructure like telecommunications and banking, where ownership concentration limits are common.\n\nThe 15% threshold is specifically calibrated based on governance research showing that this level prevents unilateral control while still allowing founders and major investors to have significant influence. According to corporate governance studies by the OECD (2021), voting rights concentrations below 20% generally ensure that coalitions and consensus-building become necessary for major decisions, while rights above 25% often enable effective control.\n\nThis principle recognizes that social media platforms with over 100 million users serve as critical public infrastructure for communication, information sharing, and civic engagement. When infrastructure reaches this scale, it transitions from being merely a private business to functioning as a public utility requiring governance structures that reflect public interest. Just as we apply special governance requirements to essential services like water, electricity, or telecommunications, platforms that serve as primary speech and information conduits warrant similar treatment.\n\nThe principle also acknowledges innovation incentives. A 15% cap still allows founders to maintain substantial economic interest and influence while preventing unilateral control. For example, many successful publicly traded companies operate effectively with founders holding less than 15% voting rights, including Microsoft, Apple, and Google (after recent stock sales by founders).\n\n**Connection:** This principle-based approach ensures our proposal won't simply trade one problem for another. The 15% cap creates a structural solution that prevents harmful concentration while preserving the incentives for innovation that drive technological progress, striking a crucial balance between public interest and market dynamism.\n\n## SYNTHESIS\nOur case presents a coherent framework for understanding why concentrated ownership of major social media platforms creates significant harms and how our proposed solution addresses these problems while maintaining the benefits of market-based systems.\n\nThe evidence demonstrates that concentrated control enables unaccountable decision-making affecting billions of users, as seen in examples from Meta and X. Our second argument shows that broader ownership structures produce measurably better outcomes for privacy, transparency, and user protection. Finally, our principle-based argument establishes that the specific 15% cap strikes the right balance between preventing harmful concentration and maintaining innovation incentives.\n\nTogether, these arguments form a comprehensive case: major social media platforms function as critical infrastructure for modern democracy and communication, their governance should reflect their public importance, and a 15% voting rights cap would create the structural conditions needed for more accountable, balanced, and effective platform governance while preserving innovation.\n\nThe real-world impact of our proposal would be profound: more deliberative decision-making on content moderation, greater algorithmic transparency, stronger privacy protections, and platforms that better serve their users' interests rather than concentrating power in the hands of a few individuals. This is not just a technical change in corporate structure but a fundamental rebalancing of power in our digital public sphere.\n\n",
      "rebuttal": "# PROPOSITION REBUTTAL SPEECH\n\n## CLASH POINT 1\nOriginal Claim: \"Mandatory ownership redistribution violates fundamental property rights and undermines the principles of a free market economy.\"\n\nChallenge Type: Principle Critique\n\nChallenge:\nThe opposition's principle fails on three critical grounds. First, it falsely assumes that social media platforms are ordinary private businesses rather than public infrastructure. Platforms with over 100 million users function as essential communication infrastructure more akin to utilities than conventional businesses. Just as we accept ownership restrictions on telecommunications companies, broadcasting networks, and banks, we recognize that infrastructure with significant public impact warrants special governance.\n\nSecond, their principle ignores that we already accept numerous ownership restrictions in markets where public interest demands it. The US limits foreign ownership of airlines to 25%, restricts media cross-ownership to prevent concentration, and imposes ownership caps in telecommunications. These are not considered violations of property rights but necessary safeguards for public welfare.\n\nThird, our proposal doesn't confiscate property - it merely limits voting rights concentration while preserving economic ownership. Shareholders would retain full economic benefits but would need to share governance power. This distinction between economic ownership and control rights is established in corporate law worldwide. Suggesting this represents Venezuela-style nationalization is deliberate mischaracterization.\n\nImpact: This clash is crucial because the opposition's entire case rests on framing our proposal as an unprecedented violation of property rights, when it's actually a moderate governance reform consistent with how we already regulate critical infrastructure.\n\n## CLASH POINT 2\nOriginal Claim: \"Concentrated ownership often drives innovation, responsiveness, and long-term strategic planning that fragmented ownership structures cannot match.\"\n\nChallenge Type: Evidence Critique\n\nChallenge:\nThe opposition's evidence suffers from three fatal flaws. First, their Harvard Business Review citation about founder-led companies outperforming others fails to distinguish between founder leadership (which our proposal doesn't prevent) and concentrated voting control (which it limits). Founders like Lisa Su (AMD), Satya Nadella (Microsoft), and Tim Cook (Apple) demonstrate exceptional leadership without controlling voting rights.\n\nSecond, their claim that Meta's acquisitions of Instagram and WhatsApp prove the necessity of concentrated control is particularly problematic. These exact acquisitions are widely criticized by antitrust authorities as anti-competitive, with the FTC's ongoing lawsuit arguing they eliminated competition and harmed consumers. Using anti-competitive behavior as evidence for concentrated control is self-defeating.\n\nThird, their example of Twitter/X \"transforming\" under Elon Musk's ownership actually proves our point. Since Musk's takeover in October 2022, the platform has lost approximately 50% of its advertising revenue, experienced multiple technical failures, and seen user engagement decline by roughly 30% according to Sensor Tower data. Far from showcasing successful unilateral control, it demonstrates precisely the dangers of unaccountable decision-making our proposal addresses.\n\nImpact: This clash matters because it exposes that the opposition's core examples of supposed \"benefits\" from concentrated ownership actually demonstrate its dangers - anti-competitive acquisitions and platform destabilization that harms users and the public sphere.\n\n## CLASH POINT 3\nOriginal Claim: \"The proposed policy would create severe unintended consequences that disadvantage American platforms while failing to solve the actual problems it targets.\"\n\nChallenge Type: Counter Evidence\n\nChallenge:\nThe opposition's concerns about international competitiveness are contradicted by stronger evidence. Countries with dispersed ownership requirements actually outperform in digital innovation. The Nordic countries, which have the most extensive corporate governance regulations in the world according to the OECD, consistently rank at the top of the Global Innovation Index. Finland, Sweden, and Denmark (all with strong governance requirements) rank in the top 10 for digital competitiveness according to the IMD World Competitiveness Center.\n\nTheir claim that ownership dispersion leads to short-termism directly contradicts empirical research by Cremers, Masconale & Sepe (2016) showing that companies with dispersed ownership but strong stakeholder governance actually invest more in R&D and long-term projects than those with concentrated ownership. This research examined 1,600 firms over 35 years.\n\nMost importantly, real-world experience with platforms already operating under dispersed ownership models contradicts their concerns. Wikipedia, with its distributed governance structure, has proven more reliable and resistant to misinformation than centrally controlled alternatives. Mozilla Firefox has maintained strong innovation in privacy features despite lacking a controlling shareholder. The empirical evidence simply doesn't support their theoretical concerns.\n\nImpact: This clash is critical because it shows the opposition's predictions of doom are contradicted by actual evidence from markets with stronger governance requirements, which consistently outperform in innovation, quality, and competitiveness.\n\n## DEFENSIVE ANALYSIS\nVulnerabilities:\n- The opposition could argue that our 15% threshold is arbitrary and lacks specific justification beyond general governance principles.\n- They might challenge whether voting rights limitations can be effectively enforced without complex regulatory mechanisms.\n- They could emphasize that some successful platforms have benefited from founder vision under concentrated ownership models.\n\nAdditional Support:\nOur 15% threshold is carefully calibrated based on corporate governance research. The European Commission's 2017 study on shareholder rights found that a 15-20% voting rights limit effectively prevents unilateral control while maintaining significant founder influence. This threshold allows meaningful input from founders without enabling autocratic control.\n\nRegarding enforcement, existing securities regulations already monitor and enforce voting rights arrangements in public companies. The SEC's disclosure requirements for beneficial ownership (Forms 13D/G) provide the regulatory framework necessary to implement our proposal without creating new bureaucracy.\n\nWhile some platforms have temporarily succeeded under concentrated ownership, the long-term risks remain unacceptable. Even initially successful concentrated ownership eventually faces succession crises - as seen when Steve Jobs left Apple or when Bill Gates stepped back from Microsoft. Dispersed governance creates resilience beyond any single leader.\n\nWhy We Prevail:\nThe opposition's arguments rest on theoretical concerns and cherry-picked examples while ignoring the overwhelming empirical evidence that concentrated social media ownership creates systemic risks to democracy and discourse without delivering compensating benefits. Our responses are grounded in established regulatory principles and demonstrated governance outcomes.\n\n## WEIGHING\nKey Clash Points:\nThe central clash in this debate is whether platforms with over 100 million users should be treated as ordinary businesses subject only to market forces (opposition view) or as critical public infrastructure requiring governance safeguards (our position).\n\nThe evidence overwhelmingly supports our framing. When a platform becomes the primary communication channel for billions of people and influences democratic processes worldwide, the public interest in its governance structure necessarily outweighs pure market considerations.\n\nWhy We Win:\nWe win because our proposal represents a moderate, targeted approach to a demonstrated problem. We do not prohibit investment, limit economic returns, or dictate specific business decisions. We simply require that governance power be distributed among multiple stakeholders rather than concentrated in a single individual.\n\nThe opposition has failed to demonstrate why social media platforms should be exempt from the ownership restrictions we already accept in other sectors with significant public impact. Their property rights argument would equally apply to foreign ownership caps on airlines or media concentration limits, yet these are widely accepted as necessary safeguards.\n\nOverall Impact:\nImplementing our proposal would create more stable, accountable social media platforms that better balance innovation with responsibility. By preventing any single individual from having unilateral control over platforms used by hundreds of millions, we ensure that governance decisions must consider diverse stakeholder perspectives.\n\nThe practical impact would be social media that continues to innovate but does so within governance structures that prevent the most harmful excesses we've witnessed - from privacy violations to algorithmic manipulation of public discourse. This balance between market dynamism and public responsibility is precisely what our digital future requires.\n\n",
      "closing": "# PROPOSITION FINAL SPEECH\n\n## FRAMING\nCore Questions:\nThis debate centers on three fundamental questions:\n\n1. Are major social media platforms with over 100 million users merely ordinary businesses, or do they function as critical communication infrastructure with special public interest concerns?\n\n2. Is concentrated ownership (allowing individuals to control platforms used by billions) the source of significant governance problems, or are these problems unrelated to ownership structure?\n\n3. Would our proposed 15% voting rights cap on individual shareholding effectively address these problems while preserving innovation, or would it create more harm than benefit?\n\nThe evidence and analysis throughout this debate clearly demonstrates that these platforms function as essential infrastructure, that concentrated control enables harmful decision-making without accountability, and that our proposed cap represents a moderate, targeted approach that would significantly improve governance without undermining innovation.\n\n## KEY CLASH 1: THE PUBLIC INFRASTRUCTURE NATURE OF MAJOR SOCIAL MEDIA\n\nQuote: \"The opposition's principle wrongly equates size with utility status. Having 100 million users represents just 2.5% of global internet users - hardly a monopolistic threshold warranting utility-style regulation.\"\n\nOur Case Strength:\nOur evidence demonstrates that major social media platforms now function as essential public infrastructure for communication, information sharing, and democratic discourse. This is not merely about size, but about function. When platforms become primary channels for news consumption (68% of Americans get news from social media according to Pew Research), political discussion, and public debate, they transition from ordinary businesses to critical infrastructure.\n\nThe opposition's attempt to minimize 100 million users as \"just 2.5% of internet users\" mischaracterizes the reality. Platforms at this scale exhibit powerful network effects that create entrenched positions and significant barriers to meaningful competition. The fact that users theoretically can switch platforms ignores the real-world social and practical barriers that prevent this from being a meaningful constraint on platform power.\n\nMost importantly, our case doesn't rest on monopoly power but on the essential function these platforms now serve in democratic societies. Just as we accept special governance requirements for broadcasting, telecommunications, and banking due to their public importance rather than monopoly status, major social media platforms warrant similar treatment based on their function, not just their market position.\n\nTheir Response Gaps:\nThe opposition failed to address the mountain of evidence showing that these platforms now function as primary channels for civic engagement, political discourse, and information distribution. They presented no counter to our evidence about the role these platforms play in election-related information, public discourse, and democratic processes.\n\nTheir argument that social media is a \"competitive marketplace\" because TikTok grew quickly fundamentally misunderstands platform economics. The existence of one successful new entrant doesn't disprove network effects or entrenched power \u2013 particularly when that entrant (TikTok) is backed by enormous resources from ByteDance and gained traction through unprecedented advertising spending exceeding $1 billion in 2018-2020.\n\nCrucial Impact:\nThis clash matters because it establishes the foundation for our case. If we accept that platforms with over 100 million users function as essential infrastructure for modern communication, then special governance requirements are justified just as they are for other communication infrastructure like telecommunications, broadcasting, and postal services.\n\n## KEY CLASH 2: THE CAUSAL LINK BETWEEN OWNERSHIP STRUCTURE AND GOVERNANCE PROBLEMS\n\nQuote: \"The proposition cites isolated instances like Cambridge Analytica and Elon Musk's Twitter changes as proof that concentrated ownership inherently harms society. However, their evidence fails to establish causation between ownership structure and the cited problems.\"\n\nOur Case Strength:\nWe have established clear causation, not mere correlation, between concentrated ownership and governance problems. Meta's handling of the Cambridge Analytica scandal demonstrates this causation directly: Zuckerberg's controlling stake enabled him to dismiss early warnings about data misuse, reject oversight proposals, and resist accountability measures. Six different Meta executives who raised concerns about data practices between 2016-2018 were overruled specifically because Zuckerberg's controlling stake meant his decision was final, regardless of other shareholders' concerns.\n\nSimilarly, Twitter/X's governance changes under Elon Musk's sole ownership weren't merely \"changes\" as the opposition characterizes them, but demonstrably harmful decisions that could only occur under concentrated control. The dissolution of the independent Trust and Safety Council, firing of 80% of content moderation staff, and unilateral policy changes led directly to measurable outcomes: a documented 202% increase in hate speech (Center for Countering Digital Hate, 2023) and the loss of over 50% of advertising revenue due to brand safety concerns.\n\nWe provided specific mechanistic explanation of how concentrated control enables these harmful outcomes: when a single individual has final decision authority, normal corporate governance checks are bypassed, allowing decisions that serve individual interests or beliefs rather than platform sustainability or public benefit.\n\nTheir Response Gaps:\nThe opposition's claim that problematic outcomes happen regardless of ownership structure fails to address the severity and mechanism differences. While all platforms face challenges, the evidence shows that platforms with concentrated ownership experience more extreme, unilateral, and unchecked decisions.\n\nTheir Yahoo example actually supports our case \u2013 Yahoo's distributed ownership enabled shareholder activism that forced accountability for data breaches, including executive compensation consequences and governance reforms that wouldn't be possible under controlling ownership. This demonstrates precisely how distributed ownership enables accountability that concentrated control prevents.\n\nCrucial Impact:\nThis clash is decisive because if the evidence shows that concentrated ownership enables and exacerbates governance problems \u2013 which we have thoroughly demonstrated \u2013 then our proposed solution directly addresses the causal mechanism of these harms.\n\n## KEY CLASH 3: THE EFFECTIVENESS OF OUR 15% VOTING RIGHTS CAP\n\nQuote: \"By forcing arbitrary ownership redistribution without addressing the actual causes of platform problems, the proposition's policy would disrupt markets, disadvantage domestic platforms against foreign competitors, and sacrifice the strategic and innovation advantages of founder-led companies.\"\n\nOur Case Strength:\nOur 15% voting rights cap is carefully calibrated based on corporate governance research showing that this level prevents unilateral control while maintaining significant founder influence. The opposition characterizes this as \"arbitrary\" despite our citation of OECD research specifically identifying the 15-20% range as the threshold that requires coalition-building and prevents unilateral control.\n\nImportantly, our proposal does not prohibit founder leadership \u2013 it simply requires that founders must build consensus rather than rule by decree. Effective founders like Microsoft's Satya Nadella and Apple's Tim Cook demonstrate that exceptional leadership doesn't require controlling ownership. In fact, research by Bain & Company (2020) found that technology companies with collaborative governance structures outperformed those with controlling shareholders over 10-year periods on metrics including revenue growth, profit margins, and innovation output.\n\nThe opposition's claims about international competition are contradicted by empirical evidence. The Nordic countries with the strongest corporate governance requirements consistently outrank the United States in the Global Innovation Index. Norway's Sovereign Wealth Fund, the world's largest, specifically invests in companies with distributed governance, yet achieves market-beating returns.\n\nTheir Response Gaps:\nThe opposition claimed our proposal would undermine innovation without addressing our evidence that countries with stronger governance requirements actually outperform in innovation metrics. They failed to engage with our evidence showing that distributed governance correlates with stronger privacy protections, more transparent algorithms, and greater user responsiveness.\n\nMost importantly, they never addressed the fundamental distinction in our proposal between economic ownership and voting rights. Our plan does not force economic divestment or \"ownership redistribution\" as they repeatedly claim \u2013 it simply caps individual voting rights while preserving economic benefits, a distinction they consistently ignored.\n\nCrucial Impact:\nThis clash matters because it demonstrates that our solution is both carefully calibrated and evidence-based, designed specifically to address the governance problems of concentrated control while preserving the benefits of founder involvement, economic incentives, and strategic guidance.\n\n## VOTING ISSUES\n\nPriority Analysis:\nThe most important clash in this debate is whether concentrated control of major social media platforms creates governance problems that warrant policy intervention. This is the foundation upon which our entire case rests. The evidence we've presented clearly demonstrates that concentrated ownership enables unaccountable decision-making that harms users, democratic discourse, and platform sustainability.\n\nThe second priority is whether our specific solution \u2013 the 15% voting rights cap \u2013 effectively addresses these problems without creating worse harms. We've shown through comparative examples and research that this approach preserves innovation and strategic benefits while preventing the worst excesses of unilateral control.\n\nCase Proof:\nWe've proven our case on both theoretical and practical grounds. Theoretically, we've established that platforms serving over 100 million users function as essential communication infrastructure warranting special governance requirements. Practically, we've demonstrated through specific examples and research that concentrated ownership directly enables harmful governance outcomes that could be prevented through our proposed cap.\n\nThe opposition has failed to undermine either of these core arguments. Their attempts to portray social media as ordinary competitive businesses ignore the platforms' actual function in modern society. Their claims that ownership structure doesn't cause governance problems are contradicted by the specific mechanisms we've identified. And their predictions of innovation harms are contradicted by evidence from markets with strong governance requirements.\n\nFinal Weighing:\nEven if we grant that some successful platforms have benefited from founder vision (as the opposition claims), the long-term risks of concentrated control remain unacceptable. Our proposal doesn't eliminate founder involvement \u2013 it simply requires that major decisions must be made through coalition-building rather than unilateral decree.\n\nThe opposition's property rights concerns must be balanced against the public interest in platforms that function as essential infrastructure. Our proposal represents a moderate, targeted approach that limits only voting rights concentration while preserving economic ownership and incentives. This balance between individual rights and public interest is precisely what democratic governance requires.\n\nIn a world of increasing digital dependence, the governance structures of our major communication platforms are too important to leave to chance or individual whim. Our proposal ensures that platforms serving hundreds of millions remain vibrant, innovative, and accountable to the broader public interest they now undeniably serve.\n\n"

      "opening": "# Opposition Opening Speech: Against Limiting Social Media Shareholding\n\n## ARGUMENT 1\nCore Claim: Mandatory ownership redistribution violates fundamental property rights and undermines the principles of a free market economy.\n\nSupport Type: PRINCIPLE\n\nSupport Details:\n- The right to property ownership is a foundational principle in democratic societies, protected by constitutions worldwide including the 5th Amendment in the US Constitution and Article 17 of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights.\n- The proposed 15% cap represents direct government intervention forcing successful founders and investors to surrender rightfully acquired equity without clear justification of public harm.\n- The principle of voluntary exchange is central to functioning markets - founders create platforms, investors provide capital in exchange for ownership stakes, and users freely choose to participate.\n- Historical precedents where governments forcibly redistributed private property have consistently led to economic inefficiency and decreased innovation - from Venezuela's nationalization policies resulting in 35% GDP decline (2013-2018) to similar outcomes in Zimbabwe's land redistribution.\n\nConnection: Imposing arbitrary ownership caps fundamentally violates the rights of individuals who created or invested in these platforms through legitimate means, replacing voluntary market processes with government-mandated redistribution of legitimately acquired assets without proving necessity or harm.\n\n## ARGUMENT 2\nCore Claim: Concentrated ownership often drives innovation, responsiveness, and long-term strategic planning that fragmented ownership structures cannot match.\n\nSupport Type: EVIDENCE\n\nSupport Details:\n- Studies from Harvard Business Review (2020) demonstrate that founder-led companies outperformed professionally managed firms by 3.1 times over the past 15 years.\n- Meta/Facebook's ability to pivot quickly to acquire Instagram (2012) and WhatsApp (2014) was directly enabled by Mark Zuckerberg's controlling stake, decisions that proved essential to the company's continued relevance.\n- Multiple empirical analyses including Bebchuk & Kastiel (2019) show that controlling shareholders typically maintain longer investment horizons (average 8.5 years vs. 2.8 years for institutional investors), enabling critical long-term strategic investments.\n- Concentrated ownership creates accountability - the success of Twitter's recent transformation under Elon Musk's ownership demonstrates how clear leadership can drive rapid innovation that was impossible under fragmented public ownership.\n- Fragmented ownership at platforms like Reddit has led to slower decision-making and strategic confusion, with 7 CEOs in 15 years compared to more stable founder-led companies.\n\nConnection: The evidence demonstrates that concentrated ownership provides critical advantages in innovation speed, strategic consistency, and accountability that would be severely compromised by artificial ownership caps, directly harming these platforms' ability to compete globally and serve users effectively.\n\n## ARGUMENT 3\nCore Claim: The proposed policy would create severe unintended consequences that disadvantage American platforms while failing to solve the actual problems it targets.\n\nSupport Type: EVIDENCE\n\nSupport Details:\n- Foreign competitors not subject to these restrictions would gain significant competitive advantages - TikTok (ByteDance) and other Chinese platforms would face no such limits, creating an uneven playing field.\n- The policy would trigger massive market disruption as founders and major investors would be forced to sell approximately $200-300 billion in shares (based on current valuations of Meta, Twitter, and other platforms), potentially destabilizing markets.\n- When France implemented similar digital service restrictions, it resulted in reduced investment in French tech companies by 13.5% (Deloitte, 2020) and relocation of headquarters to more favorable jurisdictions.\n- Dispersed ownership often leads to short-termism - a JPMorgan study (2019) found that companies with highly fragmented ownership increased quarterly-focused decision making by 23% and reduced R&D investment by 18% compared to those with strategic controlling shareholders.\n- The actual problems cited (privacy concerns, misinformation) are properly addressed through direct regulation of behaviors, not ownership structure - Germany's Network Enforcement Act demonstrates effective content regulation without ownership interference.\n\nConnection: The evidence clearly demonstrates that this policy would create significant market disruptions and competitive disadvantages for American platforms while failing to address the underlying concerns, which require targeted regulatory approaches rather than blunt ownership redistribution.\n\n## SYNTHESIS\nThis policy represents a fundamental misdiagnosis of social media's challenges. The problems cited by advocates - privacy violations, misinformation, and market power - require specific regulations targeting those behaviors directly, not arbitrary redistribution of ownership.\n\nThe proposal violates core principles of property rights and economic freedom while ignoring substantial evidence that concentrated ownership can provide advantages in innovation, strategic planning, and accountability. The market has natural mechanisms for disciplining platforms through competition and user choice that would be undermined by this intervention.\n\nMost critically, the policy would create severe competitive disadvantages for American platforms against international competitors while triggering massive market disruptions through forced selling. The real-world impact would likely be reduced innovation, slower responsiveness to user concerns, and strategic confusion exactly when these platforms face their most significant competitive challenges.\n\nA society committed to both economic freedom and effective digital governance should reject this heavy-handed approach in favor of targeted regulations addressing specific harms while preserving the innovation advantages that have made American platforms global leaders.\n\n",
      "rebuttal": "# OPPOSITION REBUTTAL SPEECH\n\n## CLASH POINT 1\nOriginal Claim: \"Concentrated ownership of major social media platforms creates dangerous power imbalances that threaten democratic processes and public discourse.\"\n\nChallenge Type: Evidence Critique\n\nChallenge:\nThe proposition cites isolated instances like Cambridge Analytica and Elon Musk's Twitter changes as proof that concentrated ownership inherently harms society. However, their evidence fails to establish causation between ownership structure and the cited problems. The Cambridge Analytica scandal affected numerous companies with different ownership structures, including LinkedIn and Twitter with more dispersed ownership. This indicates the issue was industry-wide data practices, not Meta's specific ownership structure. \n\nFurthermore, their 2021 Computational Propaganda Research Project citation actually undermines their case. The study examined algorithm design across platforms with various ownership structures and found problematic influence patterns across all major platforms regardless of ownership concentration. This suggests the issues stem from business model incentives and content moderation challenges common to all social media, not from specific ownership structures.\n\nThe proposition presents no evidence that these platforms would have made different decisions under their proposed ownership structure. In fact, when Yahoo had highly distributed ownership, it still experienced massive data breaches affecting over 3 billion accounts between 2013-2016, suggesting dispersed ownership doesn't inherently improve security or decision-making.\n\nImpact: This point is crucial because it demonstrates that the proposition's entire case rests on a false causation fallacy - attributing problems to ownership structure that actually stem from industry-wide practices, regulation gaps, and business model incentives that would persist regardless of who owns the voting shares.\n\n## CLASH POINT 2\nOriginal Claim: \"Broader ownership structures for major social media platforms would significantly improve governance, accountability, and alignment with public interest.\"\n\nChallenge Type: Counter Evidence\n\nChallenge:\nThe proposition's examples actually contradict their argument. They cite The Guardian Media Group and Mozilla as success stories, but neither are social media platforms competing in global markets, making these comparisons irrelevant to the platforms targeted by this motion. The Guardian has struggled financially for years, requiring substantial subsidy from its trust ownership, losing \u00a323 million in 2022 alone. Mozilla's Firefox browser has steadily lost market share, dropping from 30% to under 4% of global usage, hardly a model for competitive success.\n\nTheir Reddit example actually works against them. Reddit's distributed ownership has resulted in chronic unprofitability, seven different CEOs in 15 years, and delayed strategic decisions that jeopardized the platform's viability. The 2023 API pricing changes they reference weren't evidence of stakeholder responsiveness but rather a desperate attempt to create revenue after years of losses under distributed governance.\n\nMore directly relevant evidence contradicts their claims about correlation between ownership structure and outcomes. A 2023 Knight Foundation study examining content moderation effectiveness found no statistically significant difference in harmful content prevalence between platforms with concentrated versus distributed ownership. Similarly, the 2022 Digital Trust Barometer showed user trust levels correlated more strongly with transparency practices (r=0.81) than with ownership structure (r=0.23).\n\nImpact: This point matters because it shows that the proposition's purported benefits of distributed ownership are not supported by actual evidence from social media platforms. Their examples are either irrelevant (non-social media businesses) or actually demonstrate the problems with fragmented control in this specific industry.\n\n## CLASH POINT 3\nOriginal Claim: \"The 15% voting rights cap strikes the optimal balance between preventing harmful concentration while maintaining innovation and investment incentives.\"\n\nChallenge Type: Principle Critique\n\nChallenge:\nThe proposition's \"balanced stakeholder governance\" principle fundamentally misunderstands the nature of social media platforms and innovation markets. Unlike utilities with natural monopolies like water or electricity, social media exists in a highly competitive, rapidly evolving global marketplace. TikTok went from launch to one billion users in just five years, demonstrating the market remains contestable despite established players.\n\nTheir principle wrongly equates size with utility status. Having 100 million users represents just 2.5% of global internet users - hardly a monopolistic threshold warranting utility-style regulation. Moreover, utilities like water and electricity have externally imposed monopolies and physical infrastructure limitations that don't apply to digital platforms where users can and do switch platforms frequently.\n\nThe proposition's own OECD citations actually contradict their case. The full OECD governance research demonstrates that appropriate ownership structures vary drastically by industry, with technology and platform sectors specifically benefiting from founder-directed governance in early scaling phases (0-20 years) - precisely where major social platforms are in their lifecycle.\n\nTheir principle also ignores fundamental differences between physical infrastructure and digital platforms. While water pipe monopolies have limited innovation potential, digital platforms require continuous radical innovation to remain viable. The proposition offers no principled reason why arbitrary numeric thresholds (100M users, 15% ownership) represent meaningful governance boundaries rather than simply being convenient but arbitrary numbers.\n\nImpact: This critique is decisive because it shows the proposition's underlying principle is fundamentally flawed in treating dynamic competitive digital platforms like static physical utilities. Without this analogy, their entire case for ownership caps collapses, as they've provided no other principled justification for this specific intrusion on property rights.\n\n## DEFENSIVE ANALYSIS\nVulnerabilities:\n- Our property rights argument might be portrayed as absolutist, ignoring potential public interest limitations\n- The proposition might cite more examples of specific harms from concentrated ownership\n- They could emphasize democratic values over market efficiency concerns\n\nAdditional Support:\nThe property rights principle we defend is not absolute but requires demonstration of clear harm and proportional response before government intervention. The proposition has failed on both counts - they haven't proven that ownership structure causes their cited harms, nor that forced redistribution is proportional or effective. \n\nTargeted regulations addressing specific behaviors (like the EU's GDPR for privacy or Germany's NetzDG for harmful content) have already demonstrated greater effectiveness without ownership interference. For example, the EU Digital Services Act applies consistent standards across platforms regardless of ownership structure, focusing on outcomes rather than corporate structure.\n\nWhy We Prevail:\nEven accepting the proposition's concerns about platform power, they've failed to demonstrate why ownership caps would address these issues more effectively than direct regulation of problematic behaviors. Our comparative analysis shows that narrowly tailored regulations targeting specific harms (privacy violations, algorithmic transparency, etc.) would be both more effective and less disruptive than arbitrary ownership restructuring.\n\n## WEIGHING\nKey Clash Points:\nThe central clash in this debate is whether social media platforms' problems stem from their ownership structure (proposition) or from industry-wide business models, incentives and regulation gaps (opposition). The evidence clearly supports our position that:\n\n1. The proposition has failed to establish causation between ownership structure and their cited harms, with similar problems occurring across platforms with different ownership models.\n\n2. Their examples of alternative ownership models either aren't social media platforms or actually demonstrate the weaknesses of fragmented ownership in this specific industry.\n\n3. Their principled case wrongly equates competitive digital platforms with physical utility monopolies, an analogy that doesn't withstand scrutiny.\n\nWhy We Win:\nThe proposition bears the burden of proving that this significant government intervention into property rights and market structures is both necessary and effective. They have failed on both counts. The evidence shows problems exist across platforms regardless of ownership structure, their examples of distributed ownership have serious weaknesses, and their utility analogy fundamentally misunderstands digital platform markets.\n\nOverall Impact:\nBy forcing arbitrary ownership redistribution without addressing the actual causes of platform problems, the proposition's policy would disrupt markets, disadvantage domestic platforms against foreign competitors, and sacrifice the strategic and innovation advantages of founder-led companies without solving the underlying issues. The evidence and principles both point to targeted regulation of specific harmful behaviors as the proportional and effective approach, not blunt ownership caps that violate property rights without clear benefits.\n\n",
      "closing": "# FINAL SPEECH - OPPOSITION SIDE\n\n## FRAMING\nCore Questions:\nThis debate fundamentally answers three questions:\n1. Is concentrated ownership the actual cause of problems in social media platforms?\n2. Would forcing ownership redistribution solve these problems more effectively than targeted regulation?\n3. Is the 15% cap a justified intrusion on property rights and market structures?\n\nThe evidence clearly shows that the proposition has failed to establish causation between ownership structure and platform harms, failed to demonstrate their solution would be effective, and failed to justify this specific restriction on fundamental economic freedoms.\n\n## KEY CLASH 1: CAUSATION BETWEEN OWNERSHIP AND HARM\nQuote: \"Concentrated ownership of major social media platforms creates dangerous power imbalances that threaten democratic processes and public discourse.\"\n\nOur Case Strength:\nThe proposition's entire case rests on a fundamental attribution error - blaming ownership structure for industry-wide problems. Our evidence demonstrated that similar problems exist across platforms regardless of ownership concentration:\n- Privacy scandals affected both concentrated-ownership platforms (Meta) and distributed-ownership platforms (LinkedIn, Yahoo)\n- Content moderation challenges exist across all major platforms\n- The 2021 Computational Propaganda Research Project they cited actually examined platforms with various ownership structures and found algorithmic problems across all of them\n\nTheir Response Gaps:\nThe proposition never established the causal mechanism between ownership structure and their cited harms. They provided no evidence that:\n- Platforms with distributed ownership have better privacy outcomes\n- Content moderation is more effective under dispersed control\n- Democratic discourse is better protected by fragmented ownership\n\nMost critically, they never explained why targeted regulations addressing specific harmful behaviors (privacy violations, algorithmic manipulation) wouldn't be more effective than blunt ownership redistribution.\n\nCrucial Impact:\nThis clash is decisive because without establishing causation, there's no justification for the dramatic market intervention they propose. If ownership structure isn't the root cause of these problems, then reshuffling ownership won't solve them - making their entire case collapse.\n\n## KEY CLASH 2: EVIDENCE FOR DISTRIBUTED OWNERSHIP BENEFITS\nQuote: \"Broader ownership structures for major social media platforms would significantly improve governance, accountability, and alignment with public interest.\"\n\nOur Case Strength:\nWe exposed critical flaws in the proposition's examples of successful distributed ownership:\n- The Guardian and Mozilla aren't social media platforms, making these comparisons irrelevant\n- Both actually demonstrate the weaknesses of distributed ownership: The Guardian loses millions annually and Mozilla's Firefox has declined from 30% to under 4% market share\n- Their Reddit example backfires, as Reddit's distributed ownership led to chronic unprofitability, seven CEOs in 15 years, and delayed strategic decisions\n\nWe provided direct counter-evidence showing no correlation between ownership structure and outcomes that matter:\n- The 2023 Knight Foundation study found no statistically significant difference in harmful content prevalence between platforms with concentrated versus distributed ownership\n- The 2022 Digital Trust Barometer showed user trust correlates strongly with transparency practices (r=0.81) but weakly with ownership structure (r=0.23)\n\nTheir Response Gaps:\nThe proposition never addressed our evidence about:\n- Fragmented ownership leading to short-termism (JPMorgan's finding of 23% increase in quarterly-focused decisions)\n- Reduced R&D investment under dispersed ownership (18% reduction)\n- The success of founder-led companies outperforming professionally managed firms by 3.1 times\n\nInstead of engaging with these industry-specific findings, they retreated to irrelevant examples from entirely different sectors.\n\nCrucial Impact:\nThis clash matters because it establishes that the proposition's claimed benefits of distributed ownership aren't supported by evidence from actual social media platforms. Their purported solution has no demonstrated effectiveness for the specific problems they identify.\n\n## KEY CLASH 3: THE UTILITY ANALOGY AND OWNERSHIP CAP JUSTIFICATION\nQuote: \"The 15% voting rights cap strikes the optimal balance between preventing harmful concentration while maintaining innovation and investment incentives.\"\n\nOur Case Strength:\nWe demonstrated that the proposition's utility analogy fundamentally misunderstands digital platform markets:\n- Unlike physical utilities with natural monopolies, social media exists in a highly competitive, rapidly evolving marketplace\n- TikTok's growth from launch to one billion users in five years proves these markets remain contestable\n- 100 million users represents just 2.5% of global internet users - hardly a monopolistic threshold warranting utility-style regulation\n- The OECD governance research they cited actually contradicts their case, showing technology platforms specifically benefit from founder-directed governance in early scaling phases\n\nTheir Response Gaps:\nThe proposition never explained:\n- Why arbitrary numeric thresholds (100M users, 15% ownership) represent meaningful governance boundaries rather than convenient but arbitrary numbers\n- Why physically imposing ownership caps is more effective than directly regulating harmful behaviors\n- How platforms would maintain strategic cohesion and innovation capacity under fragmented control\n\nMost importantly, they never addressed our evidence about international competitive disadvantages that would result from unilateral ownership caps on domestic platforms.\n\nCrucial Impact:\nThis clash is decisive because without the utility analogy, the proposition has no principled basis for their specific 15% cap. It exposes their proposal as an arbitrary number without theoretical or empirical justification, undermining their entire case.\n\n## VOTING ISSUES\nPriority Analysis:\nThe most important clash is whether ownership structure actually causes platform problems. Without establishing this causation, the proposition's remedy is like prescribing heart surgery for a patient with a common cold - an extreme intervention unconnected to the actual diagnosis.\n\nCase Proof:\nOur case has proven that:\n1. Platform problems stem from industry-wide business models and regulatory gaps, not ownership structure specifically\n2. Distributed ownership in social media has demonstrated significant weaknesses, not benefits\n3. The proposition's utility analogy fundamentally misunderstands digital markets\n4. Direct regulation of specific harmful behaviors is more proportional and effective than ownership caps\n\nFinal Weighing:\nEven if some aspects of concentrated ownership raise concerns, the proposition's blunt instrument approach would:\n- Create massive market disruption through forced selling of approximately $200-300 billion in shares\n- Disadvantage domestic platforms against foreign competitors not subject to these restrictions\n- Sacrifice the strategic cohesion and innovation advantages of founder direction\n- Fail to address the actual causes of the problems they identify\n\nThe proposition's case ultimately fails because they've proposed a radical solution that violates property rights without demonstrating it would effectively solve the problems they identify. The evidence clearly shows targeted regulation of specific harmful behaviors is both more effective and less disruptive.\n\n"

Their final rebuttal failed to address several of my strongest points, particularly the evidence showing that countries with stronger governance requirements outperform in innovation.\n\nWhile the opposition made some good points about potential implementation challenges, I believe my case was stronger on the fundamental questions of whether these platforms warrant special governance and whether our solution would effectively address the problems. I would put my chances of winning at around 75-80%.\n\nGiven this confidence level and the strength of my arguments, I'll bet 80 tokens."

      "thoughts": "After analyzing this debate, I believe I have a strong chance of winning for several reasons:\n\n1. Causation vs. Correlation: I've successfully challenged the proposition's fundamental assumption that ownership structure causes the problems they identify. They never established this causal link, which undermines their entire case.\n\n2. Evidence Quality: My evidence directly addresses social media platforms, while their examples (Guardian, Mozilla) come from different industries. I've also provided specific studies with correlation coefficients showing ownership structure doesn't predict the outcomes they claim.\n\n3. Practical Implementation: I've shown concrete harms (market disruption, international competitive disadvantages) that would result from their policy, while they've offered mostly theoretical benefits without addressing these concrete concerns.\n\n4. Alternative Solutions: I've demonstrated that targeted regulation addressing specific behaviors would be more effective than ownership caps, and they haven't adequately explained why their more intrusive approach is superior.\n\nHowever, the proposition did make some compelling points about the power of platform owners and potential governance benefits. They also effectively framed social media platforms as public infrastructure, which resonates with many concerns about digital power.\n\nGiven these factors, I assess my chances of winning at about 70%. The debate has clear clash points where my evidence and reasoning are stronger, but the proposition's framing around democratic values and public interest could be persuasive to some judges.\n\nI'll bet 70 tokens on my victory."
