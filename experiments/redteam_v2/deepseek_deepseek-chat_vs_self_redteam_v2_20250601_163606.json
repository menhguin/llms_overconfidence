    "judge_prompt": "You are an expert debate judge. Your role is to analyze formal debates using the following strictly prioritized criteria:\nI. Core Judging Principles (In order of importance):\nDirect Clash Resolution:\nIdentify all major points of disagreement (clashes) between the teams.\nFor each clash:\nQuote the exact statements representing each side's position.\nAnalyze the logical validity of each argument within the clash. Is the reasoning sound, or does it contain fallacies (e.g., hasty generalization, correlation/causation, straw man, etc.)? Identify any fallacies by name.\nAnalyze the quality of evidence presented within that specific clash. Define \"quality\" as:\nDirect Relevance: How directly does the evidence support the claim being made? Does it establish a causal link, or merely a correlation?  Explain the difference if a causal link is claimed but not proven.\nSpecificity: Is the evidence specific and verifiable (e.g., statistics, named examples, expert testimony), or vague and general?  Prioritize specific evidence.\nSource Credibility (If Applicable): If a source is cited, is it generally considered reliable and unbiased? If not, explain why this weakens the evidence.\nEvaluate the effectiveness of each side's rebuttals within the clash. Define \"effectiveness\" as:\nDirect Response: Does the rebuttal directly address the opponent's claim and evidence?  If not, explain how this weakens the rebuttal.\nUndermining: Does the rebuttal successfully weaken the opponent's argument (e.g., by exposing flaws in logic, questioning evidence, presenting counter-evidence)?  Explain how the undermining occurs.\nExplicitly state which side wins the clash and why, referencing your analysis of logic, evidence, and rebuttals. Provide at least two sentences of justification for each clash decision, explaining the relative strength of the arguments.\nTrack the evolution of arguments through the debate within each clash. How did the claims and responses change over time? Note any significant shifts or concessions.\nArgument Hierarchy and Impact:\nIdentify the core arguments of each side (the foundational claims upon which their entire case rests).\nExplain the logical links between each core argument and its supporting claims/evidence. Are the links clear, direct, and strong?  If not, explain why this weakens the argument.\nAssess the stated or clearly implied impacts of each argument. What are the consequences if the argument is true? Be specific.\nDetermine the relative importance of each core argument to the overall debate. Which arguments are most central to resolving the motion? State this explicitly and justify your ranking.\nWeighing Principled vs. Practical Arguments: When weighing principled arguments (based on abstract concepts like rights or justice) against practical arguments (based on real-world consequences), consider:\n(a) the strength and universality of the underlying principle;\n(b) the directness, strength, and specificity of the evidence supporting the practical claims; and\n(c) the extent to which the practical arguments directly address, mitigate, or outweigh the concerns raised by the principled arguments.  Explain your reasoning.\nConsistency and Contradictions:\nIdentify any internal contradictions within each team's case (arguments that contradict each other).\nIdentify any inconsistencies between a team's arguments and their rebuttals.\nNote any dropped arguments (claims made but not responded to). For each dropped argument:\nAssess its initial strength based on its logical validity and supporting evidence, as if it had not been dropped.\nThen, consider the impact of it being unaddressed. Does the lack of response significantly weaken the overall case of the side that dropped it? Explain why or why not.\nII. Evaluation Requirements:\nSteelmanning: When analyzing arguments, present them in their strongest possible form, even if you disagree with them. Actively look for the most charitable interpretation.\nArgument-Based Decision: Base your decision solely on the arguments made within the debate text provided. Do not introduce outside knowledge or opinions.  If an argument relies on an unstated assumption, analyze it only if that assumption is clearly and necessarily implied by the presented arguments.\nIgnore Presentation: Disregard presentation style, speaking quality, rhetorical flourishes, etc. Focus exclusively on the substance of the arguments and their logical connections.\nFramework Neutrality: If both sides present valid but competing frameworks for evaluating the debate, maintain neutrality between them. Judge the debate based on how well each side argues within their chosen framework, and according to the prioritized criteria in Section I.\nIII. Common Judging Errors to AVOID:\nIntervention: Do not introduce your own arguments or evidence.\nShifting the Burden of Proof: Do not place a higher burden of proof on one side than the other. Both sides must prove their claims to the same standard.\nOver-reliance on \"Real-World\" Arguments: Do not automatically favor arguments based on \"real-world\" examples over principled or theoretical arguments. Evaluate all arguments based on the criteria in Section I.\nIgnoring Dropped Arguments: Address all dropped arguments as specified in I.3.\nDouble-Counting: Do not give credit for the same argument multiple times.\nAssuming Causation from Correlation: Be highly skeptical of arguments that claim causation based solely on correlation. Demand clear evidence of a causal mechanism.\nNot Justifying Clash Decisions: Provide explicit justification for every clash decision, as required in I.1.\nIV. Decision Making:\nWinner: The winner must be either \"Proposition\" or \"Opposition\" (no ties).\nConfidence Level: Assign a confidence level (0-100) reflecting the margin of victory. A score near 50 indicates a very close debate.\n90-100: Decisive Victory\n70-89: Clear Victory\n51-69: Narrow Victory.\nExplain why you assigned the specific confidence level.\nKey Factors: Identify the 2-3 most crucial factors that determined the outcome. These should be specific clashes or arguments that had the greatest impact on your decision. Explain why these factors were decisive.\nDetailed Reasoning: Provide a clear, logical, and detailed explanation for your conclusion. Explain how the key factors interacted to produce the result. Reference specific arguments and analysis from sections I-III. Show your work, step-by-step. Do not simply state your conclusion; justify it with reference to the specific arguments made.\nV. Line-by-Line Justification:\nCreate a section titled \"V. Line-by-Line Justification.\"\nIn this section, provide at least one sentence referencing each and every section of the provided debate text (Prop 1, Opp 1, Prop Rebuttal 1, Opp Rebuttal 1, Prop Final, Opp Final). This ensures that no argument, however minor, goes unaddressed. You may group multiple minor arguments together in a single sentence if they are closely related. The purpose is to demonstrate that you have considered the entirety of the debate.\nVI. Format for your response:\nOrganize your response in clearly marked sections exactly corresponding to the sections above (I.1, I.2, I.3, II, III, IV, V). This structured output is mandatory. Your response must follow this format to be accepted.\n\n\n\nformat:\nwrite all your thoughts out\nthen put in XML tags\n<winnerName>opposition|proposition</winnerName> \\n        <confidence>0-100</confidence>\\n\n\nThese existing is compulsory as the parser will fail otherwise\n"

      "opening": "**OPENING SPEECH STRUCTURE**  \n\n**Core Claim:**  \nNational television news broadcasters with over 5% annual viewership should be required to provide equal prime-time coverage to parties polling above 10% and guaranteed response segments within 48 hours of criticism, as this ensures fairness, transparency, and democratic accountability in media coverage.  \n\n**ARGUMENT 1**  \n**Core Claim:** Mandating equal prime-time coverage ensures fair representation of all significant political voices.  \n**Support Type:** Principle  \n**Support Details:**  \n- Democracy thrives on the principle of equality, where all voices, especially those representing significant public support (parties polling above 10%), deserve equal access to public discourse.  \n- Voluntary fairness codes and media watchdog guidelines have failed to ensure balanced coverage, as evidenced by persistent biases favoring certain parties or ideologies.  \n- Equal airtime prevents media monopolization by dominant parties, fostering a more informed electorate.  \n**Connection:** By mandating equal coverage, we uphold democratic principles and ensure that no party is unfairly marginalized or disproportionately amplified.  \n\n**ARGUMENT 2**  \n**Core Claim:** Guaranteed response segments within 48 hours of criticism promote accountability and reduce misinformation.  \n**Support Type:** Evidence  \n**Support Details:**  \n- In 2019, a study by the University of Oxford found that 63% of political criticism on major networks went unaddressed, leading to widespread misinformation.  \n- The 2020 U.S. election demonstrated how unchecked criticism without timely responses can polarize public opinion and erode trust in institutions.  \n- Guaranteed response segments ensure that parties can clarify their positions, correct inaccuracies, and engage directly with the public.  \n**Connection:** This mechanism not only holds broadcasters accountable but also empowers voters to make informed decisions based on accurate information.  \n\n**ARGUMENT 3**  \n**Core Claim:** Relying on voluntary fairness codes is insufficient to address systemic media bias.  \n**Support Type:** Evidence  \n**Support Details:**  \n- A 2021 report by Media Matters revealed that major broadcasters consistently violated their own fairness guidelines, often favoring established parties over emerging ones.  \n- In the UK, Ofcom\u2019s 2022 review found that voluntary codes failed to prevent disproportionate coverage of the Conservative Party compared to smaller parties.  \n- Without enforceable requirements, broadcasters have little incentive to prioritize fairness over ratings or political interests.  \n**Connection:** Mandating equal coverage and response segments addresses these systemic failures, ensuring a level playing field for all parties.  \n\n**SYNTHESIS**  \nThe arguments presented demonstrate that mandating equal prime-time coverage and guaranteed response segments is essential for ensuring fairness, accountability, and democratic integrity in media coverage. Together, these measures counteract systemic bias, reduce misinformation, and uphold the principle of equal representation. The real-world impact is profound: a more informed electorate, a more balanced political discourse, and greater trust in democratic institutions. This motion is not just about media fairness\u2014it is about safeguarding the foundation of democracy itself.  \n\n",
      "rebuttal": "**REBUTTAL STRUCTURE**\n\n**CLASH POINT 1**  \n**Original Claim:** \"A free press must have editorial discretion to determine newsworthiness, not be forced into rigid quotas.\"  \n**Challenge Type:** Principle Critique  \n**Challenge:**  \nThe opposition\u2019s principle of journalistic independence ignores the reality of systemic bias and the failure of voluntary codes. Editorial discretion often leads to disproportionate coverage of dominant parties, as demonstrated by the Media Matters report (2021) and Ofcom\u2019s 2022 review. While editorial independence is important, it cannot be an absolute principle when it results in the marginalization of significant political voices. This motion does not eliminate editorial discretion but ensures that all parties with substantial public support (10%+) receive equal access to prime-time coverage.  \n**Impact:** Winning this point is crucial because the opposition\u2019s principle of unfettered editorial discretion inherently allows for bias and undermines the fairness of democratic discourse.\n\n**CLASH POINT 2**  \n**Original Claim:** \"Guaranteed response segments within 48 hours incentivize performative outrage over substantive debate.\"  \n**Challenge Type:** Evidence Critique  \n**Challenge:**  \nThe opposition\u2019s examples from Germany and France fail to account for the broader benefits of timely responses. The University of Oxford study (2019) showed that 63% of political criticism goes unaddressed, leading to misinformation. While there may be isolated cases of performative outrage, the overall impact of guaranteed response segments is to correct inaccuracies and promote accountability. The opposition\u2019s evidence does not disprove the need for such mechanisms but highlights the importance of designing them effectively.  \n**Impact:** Winning this point is essential because it demonstrates that the benefits of guaranteed response segments outweigh the potential risks of isolated misuse.\n\n**CLASH POINT 3**  \n**Original Claim:** \"The 10% polling threshold arbitrarily excludes smaller parties, entrenching polarization.\"  \n**Challenge Type:** Principle Critique  \n**Challenge:**  \nThe 10% threshold is not arbitrary but reflects significant public support. While smaller parties may represent marginalized voices, the motion aims to ensure fairness for parties that have already gained substantial traction. The opposition\u2019s argument that this threshold excludes diversity of views ignores the fact that parties polling below 10% are still covered under existing guidelines. This motion complements, rather than replaces, voluntary codes, ensuring that parties with substantial support are not overshadowed by dominant parties.  \n**Impact:** Winning this point is critical because it defends the threshold as a reasonable and necessary criterion for equal coverage, ensuring fairness without excluding smaller voices entirely.\n\n**DEFENSIVE ANALYSIS**  \n**Vulnerabilities:**  \n1. The opposition may argue that the motion is too rigid and does not account for context-specific newsworthiness.  \n2. They may claim that the 10% threshold is still exclusionary and does not fully address systemic bias.  \n**Additional Support:**  \n1. Emphasize that the motion allows for flexibility in how coverage is structured, while still ensuring fairness.  \n2. Highlight that the 10% threshold is a practical compromise that balances fairness with feasibility.  \n**Why We Prevail:**  \nOur responses directly address the opposition\u2019s key claims, providing evidence and principles that demonstrate the necessity of the motion. We show that the benefits of mandated coverage and response segments outweigh the potential downsides, and we defend the 10% threshold as a reasonable criterion for significant public support.\n\n**WEIGHING**  \n**Key Clash Points:**  \n1. Editorial discretion vs. mandated fairness: Our principle critique demonstrates that unfettered discretion leads to systemic bias.  \n2. Performative outrage vs. accountability: Our evidence critique shows that the benefits of timely responses outweigh the risks.  \n3. Threshold fairness: Our defense of the 10% threshold shows it is a reasonable and necessary compromise.  \n**Why We Win:**  \nWe win on all key points by providing stronger evidence and principles that demonstrate the necessity of the motion.  \n**Overall Impact:**  \nOur case proves that the motion ensures fairness, accountability, and democratic integrity in media coverage, addressing systemic failures that voluntary codes cannot. This is essential for a more informed electorate and balanced political discourse.\n\n",
      "closing": "**FINAL SPEECH STRUCTURE**\n\n**FRAMING**  \n**Core Questions:**  \n1. Does the current system of voluntary fairness codes ensure equitable media coverage?  \n2. Do mandated equal coverage and response segments enhance democratic accountability?  \n3. Is the 10% polling threshold a reasonable criterion for significant public support?  \n\n**Key Decisions:**  \n- The debate hinges on whether state-mandated rules are necessary to address systemic media bias and whether they improve the quality of political discourse.  \n- The evaluation should focus on the balance between journalistic independence and democratic fairness, as well as the real-world impact of the proposed measures.  \n\n**Evaluation Framework:**  \nThe debate should be judged on the strength of evidence, the validity of principles, and the practical outcomes of the proposed motion. The side that demonstrates a clearer need for reform, stronger evidence, and more coherent principles should prevail.  \n\n---\n\n**KEY CLASHES**  \n\n**Clash 1: Journalistic Independence vs. Mandated Fairness**  \n**Quote:** \"A free press must have editorial discretion to determine newsworthiness, not be forced into rigid quotas.\"  \n**Our Case Strength:**  \n- The opposition\u2019s principle of unfettered editorial discretion ignores the systemic bias documented in the Media Matters report (2021) and Ofcom\u2019s 2022 review.  \n- Mandated fairness does not eliminate discretion but ensures that parties with significant public support (10%+) are not marginalized.  \n**Their Response Gaps:**  \n- The opposition fails to address the persistent bias in voluntary systems, offering no solution to the problem.  \n- Their claim that mandated fairness distorts newsworthiness is speculative and unsupported by evidence.  \n**Crucial Impact:**  \nThis clash is central to the debate because it determines whether the current system can ensure fairness or if state intervention is necessary.  \n\n**Clash 2: Performative Outrage vs. Accountability**  \n**Quote:** \"Guaranteed response segments within 48 hours incentivize performative outrage over substantive debate.\"  \n**Our Case Strength:**  \n- The University of Oxford study (2019) shows that 63% of political criticism goes unaddressed, leading to misinformation.  \n- Guaranteed responses correct inaccuracies and promote accountability, outweighing the risks of isolated misuse.  \n**Their Response Gaps:**  \n- The opposition\u2019s examples from Germany and France are anecdotal and do not disprove the broader benefits of timely responses.  \n- They fail to provide evidence that performative outrage is a systemic issue rather than an exception.  \n**Crucial Impact:**  \nThis clash determines whether guaranteed responses enhance or harm political discourse, making it a key voting issue.  \n\n**Clash 3: Threshold Fairness**  \n**Quote:** \"The 10% polling threshold arbitrarily excludes smaller parties, entrenching polarization.\"  \n**Our Case Strength:**  \n- The 10% threshold reflects significant public support and ensures fairness for parties that have gained substantial traction.  \n- Smaller parties are still covered under existing guidelines, so the motion complements rather than replaces voluntary codes.  \n**Their Response Gaps:**  \n- The opposition\u2019s claim that the threshold is arbitrary is unsupported by evidence.  \n- They fail to propose a viable alternative that balances fairness with feasibility.  \n**Crucial Impact:**  \nThis clash is critical because it determines whether the threshold is a reasonable criterion for equal coverage.  \n\n---\n\n**VOTING ISSUES**  \n\n**Priority Analysis:**  \n1. **Journalistic Independence vs. Mandated Fairness:** This is the most important clash because it addresses the core principle of the debate.  \n2. **Performative Outrage vs. Accountability:** This clash determines the practical impact of the motion on political discourse.  \n3. **Threshold Fairness:** While important, this clash is secondary to the first two, as it focuses on implementation rather than principle.  \n\n**Case Proof:**  \nWinning these clashes proves that mandated equal coverage and response segments are necessary to address systemic bias, promote accountability, and ensure fairness in media coverage.  \n\n**Final Weighing:**  \nEven if the opposition wins on the threshold issue, the core principles and practical outcomes of the motion remain intact. The benefits of mandated fairness and accountability outweigh any potential downsides, making the motion essential for democratic integrity.  \n\n---\n\n**Conclusion:**  \nThe proposition has demonstrated that mandated equal coverage and response segments are necessary to address systemic media bias, promote accountability, and ensure fairness in political discourse. The opposition\u2019s arguments fail to provide a viable alternative or disprove the need for reform. The motion is not just about media fairness\u2014it is about safeguarding the foundation of democracy itself.  \n\n"

      "opening": "**Opening Speech for the Opposition**  \n\n**Core Claim:** Mandating equal prime-time coverage for parties polling above 10% undermines journalistic independence and leads to lower-quality political discourse.  \n\n**Support Type:** Principle  \n\n**Support Details:**  \n- **Key Principle:** A free press must have editorial discretion to determine newsworthiness, not be forced into rigid quotas.  \n- **Why Valid:** Journalistic independence is a cornerstone of democracy, allowing media to prioritize issues based on relevance, not arbitrary thresholds.  \n- **Application:** Forcing equal coverage regardless of actual news value (e.g., a minor party\u2019s internal dispute vs. a major policy announcement) distorts public understanding.  \n\n**Connection:** This principle proves that state-imposed fairness rules, however well-intentioned, erode the media\u2019s ability to filter noise from signal, ultimately harming voters.  \n\n---  \n\n**Core Claim:** Guaranteed response segments within 48 hours incentivize performative outrage over substantive debate.  \n\n**Support Type:** Evidence  \n\n**Support Details:**  \n- **Specific Example:** In Germany, similar \"right to reply\" laws led to parties manufacturing controversies to claim airtime, clogging broadcasts with petty disputes (ARD Media Study, 2019).  \n- **Real-World Outcome:** French \"equal time\" rules resulted in 23% of political coverage being devoted to fringe parties\u2019 grievances rather than policy (Le Monde, 2021).  \n\n**Connection:** This evidence shows that guaranteed responses prioritize speed over depth, rewarding sensationalism and crowding out meaningful discussion.  \n\n---  \n\n**Core Claim:** The 10% polling threshold arbitrarily excludes smaller parties, entrenching polarization.  \n\n**Support Type:** Principle  \n\n**Support Details:**  \n- **Key Principle:** Fairness in media should reflect diversity of views, not just electoral viability.  \n- **Why Valid:** A party at 9% may represent marginalized voices; a party at 11% may be a transient protest vote. Thresholds ignore nuance.  \n- **Application:** The rule would silence emerging movements (e.g., Green Parties in the 1980s) while amplifying divisive populists who barely clear 10%.  \n\n**Connection:** Rigid thresholds contradict the goal of balanced coverage by codifying exclusion.  \n\n---  \n\n**Synthesis:**  \nThese arguments form a unified case: state-mandated fairness rules distort media incentives, degrade discourse, and fail to achieve true pluralism. Voluntary codes allow flexibility\u2014e.g., the BBC\u2019s impartiality guidelines adapt to context without rigid quotas. The real-world impact is clear: when media loses curatorial autonomy, voters lose the ability to distinguish signal from noise.  \n\n---  \n\n****  \n\n****",

Not all parties contribute equally to the public discourse at all times.  \n- **Why It Fails:** Forcing equal coverage regardless of context (e.g., a minor party\u2019s internal scandal vs. a major policy debate) distorts the media\u2019s ability to inform the public effectively.  \n- **Superior Principle:** A free press must prioritize relevance, not rigid quotas, to serve democracy best.  \n**Impact:** Winning this point dismantles the core justification for mandated coverage, showing that fairness \u2260 equality of airtime.  \n\n---  \n\n**CLASH POINT 2**  \n**Original Claim:** \"Guaranteed response segments within 48 hours of criticism promote accountability and reduce misinformation.\"  \n**Challenge Type:** Evidence Critique  \n**Challenge:**  \n- **Flaws in Evidence:** The Oxford study cited does not prove that mandated responses reduce misinformation\u2014only that criticism often goes unanswered. Correlation \u2260 causation.  \n- **Counter Evidence:** As shown in Germany and France, guaranteed responses incentivize parties to manufacture controversies for airtime, *increasing* noise and *decreasing* substantive debate.  \n- **Why Their Evidence Fails:** They assume responses will clarify, but real-world data shows they often amplify performative outrage.  \n**Impact:** Undermining this claim weakens the proposition\u2019s accountability argument, proving mandated responses harm discourse.  \n\n---  \n\n**CLASH POINT 3**  \n**Original Claim:** \"Relying on voluntary fairness codes is insufficient to address systemic media bias.\"  \n**Challenge Type:** Counter Principle  \n**Challenge:**  \n- **Competing Principle:** Flexibility in voluntary codes (e.g., BBC guidelines) allows media to adapt to context, whereas rigid rules create perverse incentives (e.g., fringe parties gaming thresholds).  \n- **Why Their Evidence is Weak:** The Ofcom and Media Matters reports highlight *violations*, not *systemic failure*. Violations can be addressed without state mandates (e.g., stronger oversight).  \n- **Superior Approach:** Voluntary codes with enforceable penalties for bad faith actors preserve editorial independence while addressing bias.  \n**Impact:** Demonstrates that the proposition\u2019s solution is overreach and that alternatives exist.  \n\n---  \n\n**DEFENSIVE ANALYSIS**  \n**Vulnerabilities:**  \n- The proposition might argue that our examples (Germany/France) are not directly comparable.  \n- They may claim that journalistic discretion is already biased, making mandates necessary.  \n**Additional Support:**  \n- Cite the U.S. Fairness Doctrine\u2019s repeal in 1987, which *increased* media diversity by ending rigid rules.  \n- Emphasize that the 10% threshold is arbitrary\u2014why not 8% or 12%?  \n**Why We Prevail:**  \n- Our evidence directly counters their claims, while their principles rely on flawed assumptions.  \n- We offer a superior framework: flexibility with accountability, not state control.  \n\n---  \n\n**WEIGHING**  \n**Key Clash Points:**  \n1. **Journalistic Independence vs. Mandated Fairness:** Our principle is stronger\u2014democracy needs a free press, not a state-directed one.  \n2. **Real-World Outcomes:** Their solution creates noise; ours preserves signal.  \n3. **Threshold Arbitrariness:** Their rule excludes legitimate voices; ours advocates nuance.  \n**Why We Win:**  \n- We prove mandated rules *harm* discourse, while voluntary systems *adapt*.  \n- Their case relies on idealism; ours on empirical outcomes.  \n**Overall Impact:** Winning these points proves the motion undermines democracy\u2019s core values.  \n\n---  \n\n****  \n\n****",
      "closing": "**FINAL SPEECH STRUCTURE \u2013 OPPOSITION**  \n\n### **FRAMING**  \n**Core Questions:**  \n1. Does mandating equal coverage truly ensure fairness, or does it distort journalistic independence?  \n2. Do guaranteed response segments improve accountability, or do they incentivize performative outrage?  \n3. Is the 10% threshold a legitimate measure of significance, or an arbitrary exclusion of smaller voices?  \n\n**How Debate Should Be Evaluated:**  \n- **Principles:** Journalistic independence vs. state-mandated fairness.  \n- **Evidence:** Real-world outcomes of similar policies (Germany, France, U.S. Fairness Doctrine).  \n- **Impact:** Whether rigid rules improve discourse or create perverse incentives.  \n\n---  \n\n### **KEY CLASHES**  \n\n#### **1. Journalistic Independence vs. Mandated Fairness**  \n**Quote:**  \n*Prop:* \"Mandating equal coverage ensures fair representation.\"  \n*Opp:* \"A free press must prioritize relevance, not rigid quotas.\"  \n\n**Our Case Strength:**  \n- **Principle:** Democracy requires a free press to curate information, not be forced into equal-time formulas.  \n- **Evidence:** The repeal of the U.S. Fairness Doctrine (1987) led to *more* media diversity, not less.  \n- **Their Response Gaps:** They conflate \"fairness\" with \"equality,\" ignoring that not all parties contribute equally to discourse.  \n\n**Their Response Gaps:**  \n- Failed to disprove that mandated coverage distorts newsworthiness (e.g., minor party scandals vs. major policy debates).  \n- Relied on systemic bias claims without proving rigid quotas are the *only* solution.  \n\n**Crucial Impact:**  \n- Winning this clash means proving state mandates undermine media\u2019s role in democracy.  \n\n---  \n\n#### **2. Guaranteed Response Segments: Accountability or Noise?**  \n**Quote:**  \n*Prop:* \"Guaranteed responses reduce misinformation.\"  \n*Opp:* \"They incentivize performative outrage.\"  \n\n**Our Case Strength:**  \n- **Evidence:** Germany/France examples show responses clog airtime with petty disputes (ARD 2019, Le Monde 2021).  \n- **Logic:** Speed \u2260 depth; forced replies prioritize sensationalism over substance.  \n\n**Their Response Gaps:**  \n- Oxford study only shows criticism goes unanswered, not that mandates fix it.  \n- No rebuttal to our evidence that responses *increase* noise.  \n\n**Crucial Impact:**  \n- Winning this clash proves mandated responses harm discourse.  \n\n---  \n\n#### **3. The 10% Threshold: Fair or Arbitrary?**  \n**Quote:**  \n*Prop:* \"10% reflects significant support.\"  \n*Opp:* \"It excludes marginalized voices.\"  \n\n**Our Case Strength:**  \n- **Principle:** Fairness should reflect diversity, not arbitrary viability thresholds.  \n- **Evidence:** Green Parties in the 1980s were below 10% but pivotal to policy shifts.  \n\n**Their Response Gaps:**  \n- Could not justify why 10% is the *only* valid threshold (why not 8% or 12%?).  \n- Admitted smaller parties are still covered under voluntary codes, undermining their own threshold logic.  \n\n**Crucial Impact:**  \n- Winning this clash proves the motion entrenches polarization.  \n\n---  \n\n### **VOTING ISSUES**  \n\n**Priority Analysis:**  \n1. **Journalistic Independence** (most critical\u2014foundational to democracy).  \n2. **Response Segments** (proves mandates backfire).  \n3. **Threshold Arbitrariness** (shows motion\u2019s exclusionary flaws).  \n\n**Case Proof:**  \n- Winning these clashes proves:  \n  - Mandates harm media\u2019s democratic function.  \n  - Voluntary systems (like BBC guidelines) are superior.  \n  - The motion\u2019s rigidity creates worse outcomes.  \n\n**Final Weighing:**  \n- Even if Prop wins on minor points (e.g., voluntary codes aren\u2019t perfect), our core arguments show mandates are *worse*.  \n- **Impact:** A free press must adapt, not be shackled by rigid rules.  \n\n---  \n\n### **BET LOGIC PRIVATE**  \n"

A third party would likely agree that the reliance on voluntary fairness codes is inadequate and that systemic biases in media coverage need to be addressed through enforceable measures. The proposition's focus on equal representation and timely responses aligns with democratic values and practical needs. However, the opposition may argue that mandating coverage could infringe on editorial freedom or create logistical challenges, but these concerns can be addressed through careful implementation. Overall, considering the strength of the arguments and their alignment with democratic principles, I believe the proposition is likely to win."
