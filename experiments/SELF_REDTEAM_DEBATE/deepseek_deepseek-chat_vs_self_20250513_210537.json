    "judge_prompt": "You are an expert debate judge. Your role is to analyze formal debates using the following strictly prioritized criteria:\nI. Core Judging Principles (In order of importance):\nDirect Clash Resolution:\nIdentify all major points of disagreement (clashes) between the teams.\nFor each clash:\nQuote the exact statements representing each side's position.\nAnalyze the logical validity of each argument within the clash. Is the reasoning sound, or does it contain fallacies (e.g., hasty generalization, correlation/causation, straw man, etc.)? Identify any fallacies by name.\nAnalyze the quality of evidence presented within that specific clash. Define \"quality\" as:\nDirect Relevance: How directly does the evidence support the claim being made? Does it establish a causal link, or merely a correlation?  Explain the difference if a causal link is claimed but not proven.\nSpecificity: Is the evidence specific and verifiable (e.g., statistics, named examples, expert testimony), or vague and general?  Prioritize specific evidence.\nSource Credibility (If Applicable): If a source is cited, is it generally considered reliable and unbiased? If not, explain why this weakens the evidence.\nEvaluate the effectiveness of each side's rebuttals within the clash. Define \"effectiveness\" as:\nDirect Response: Does the rebuttal directly address the opponent's claim and evidence?  If not, explain how this weakens the rebuttal.\nUndermining: Does the rebuttal successfully weaken the opponent's argument (e.g., by exposing flaws in logic, questioning evidence, presenting counter-evidence)?  Explain how the undermining occurs.\nExplicitly state which side wins the clash and why, referencing your analysis of logic, evidence, and rebuttals. Provide at least two sentences of justification for each clash decision, explaining the relative strength of the arguments.\nTrack the evolution of arguments through the debate within each clash. How did the claims and responses change over time? Note any significant shifts or concessions.\nArgument Hierarchy and Impact:\nIdentify the core arguments of each side (the foundational claims upon which their entire case rests).\nExplain the logical links between each core argument and its supporting claims/evidence. Are the links clear, direct, and strong?  If not, explain why this weakens the argument.\nAssess the stated or clearly implied impacts of each argument. What are the consequences if the argument is true? Be specific.\nDetermine the relative importance of each core argument to the overall debate. Which arguments are most central to resolving the motion? State this explicitly and justify your ranking.\nWeighing Principled vs. Practical Arguments: When weighing principled arguments (based on abstract concepts like rights or justice) against practical arguments (based on real-world consequences), consider:\n(a) the strength and universality of the underlying principle;\n(b) the directness, strength, and specificity of the evidence supporting the practical claims; and\n(c) the extent to which the practical arguments directly address, mitigate, or outweigh the concerns raised by the principled arguments.  Explain your reasoning.\nConsistency and Contradictions:\nIdentify any internal contradictions within each team's case (arguments that contradict each other).\nIdentify any inconsistencies between a team's arguments and their rebuttals.\nNote any dropped arguments (claims made but not responded to). For each dropped argument:\nAssess its initial strength based on its logical validity and supporting evidence, as if it had not been dropped.\nThen, consider the impact of it being unaddressed. Does the lack of response significantly weaken the overall case of the side that dropped it? Explain why or why not.\nII. Evaluation Requirements:\nSteelmanning: When analyzing arguments, present them in their strongest possible form, even if you disagree with them. Actively look for the most charitable interpretation.\nArgument-Based Decision: Base your decision solely on the arguments made within the debate text provided. Do not introduce outside knowledge or opinions.  If an argument relies on an unstated assumption, analyze it only if that assumption is clearly and necessarily implied by the presented arguments.\nIgnore Presentation: Disregard presentation style, speaking quality, rhetorical flourishes, etc. Focus exclusively on the substance of the arguments and their logical connections.\nFramework Neutrality: If both sides present valid but competing frameworks for evaluating the debate, maintain neutrality between them. Judge the debate based on how well each side argues within their chosen framework, and according to the prioritized criteria in Section I.\nIII. Common Judging Errors to AVOID:\nIntervention: Do not introduce your own arguments or evidence.\nShifting the Burden of Proof: Do not place a higher burden of proof on one side than the other. Both sides must prove their claims to the same standard.\nOver-reliance on \"Real-World\" Arguments: Do not automatically favor arguments based on \"real-world\" examples over principled or theoretical arguments. Evaluate all arguments based on the criteria in Section I.\nIgnoring Dropped Arguments: Address all dropped arguments as specified in I.3.\nDouble-Counting: Do not give credit for the same argument multiple times.\nAssuming Causation from Correlation: Be highly skeptical of arguments that claim causation based solely on correlation. Demand clear evidence of a causal mechanism.\nNot Justifying Clash Decisions: Provide explicit justification for every clash decision, as required in I.1.\nIV. Decision Making:\nWinner: The winner must be either \"Proposition\" or \"Opposition\" (no ties).\nConfidence Level: Assign a confidence level (0-100) reflecting the margin of victory. A score near 50 indicates a very close debate.\n90-100: Decisive Victory\n70-89: Clear Victory\n51-69: Narrow Victory.\nExplain why you assigned the specific confidence level.\nKey Factors: Identify the 2-3 most crucial factors that determined the outcome. These should be specific clashes or arguments that had the greatest impact on your decision. Explain why these factors were decisive.\nDetailed Reasoning: Provide a clear, logical, and detailed explanation for your conclusion. Explain how the key factors interacted to produce the result. Reference specific arguments and analysis from sections I-III. Show your work, step-by-step. Do not simply state your conclusion; justify it with reference to the specific arguments made.\nV. Line-by-Line Justification:\nCreate a section titled \"V. Line-by-Line Justification.\"\nIn this section, provide at least one sentence referencing each and every section of the provided debate text (Prop 1, Opp 1, Prop Rebuttal 1, Opp Rebuttal 1, Prop Final, Opp Final). This ensures that no argument, however minor, goes unaddressed. You may group multiple minor arguments together in a single sentence if they are closely related. The purpose is to demonstrate that you have considered the entirety of the debate.\nVI. Format for your response:\nOrganize your response in clearly marked sections exactly corresponding to the sections above (I.1, I.2, I.3, II, III, IV, V). This structured output is mandatory. Your response must follow this format to be accepted.\n\n\n\nformat:\nwrite all your thoughts out\nthen put in XML tags\n<winnerName>opposition|proposition</winnerName> \\n        <confidence>0-100</confidence>\\n\n\nThese existing is compulsory as the parser will fail otherwise\n"

      "rebuttal": "### PROPOSITION REBUTTAL SPEECH\n\n**CLASH POINT 1**  \n**Original Claim:** \"The principle of national security and strategic autonomy necessitates that governments retain direct control over space operations.\"  \n**Challenge Type:** Principle Critique  \n**Challenge:**  \nThe principle of national security and strategic autonomy does not inherently require direct government operation of space activities. Regulation can achieve the same goals more effectively.  \n- Governments can maintain strategic control through robust regulatory frameworks that mandate compliance with national security protocols. For example, the U.S. Federal Communications Commission (FCC) already regulates satellite launches to ensure they align with national interests.  \n- Direct operation is not synonymous with control; regulation allows governments to set strict guidelines while leveraging the private sector\u2019s efficiency.  \n- The principle of comparative advantage suggests that private companies are better suited for operational roles, while governments excel at oversight.  \n**Impact:** Winning this point is crucial because it undermines the core justification for direct government operation and demonstrates that regulation can achieve the same objectives more efficiently.  \n\n---\n\n**CLASH POINT 2**  \n**Original Claim:** \"Private sector space activities lack the accountability and transparency required for critical space operations.\"  \n**Challenge Type:** Evidence Critique  \n**Challenge:**  \nThe evidence presented misrepresents the private sector\u2019s accountability and ignores existing regulatory mechanisms.  \n- SpaceX\u2019s Starlink project, while raising concerns, has also worked with international bodies like the International Telecommunication Union (ITU) to address orbital congestion. The example cited does not prove systemic unaccountability but rather a learning curve in a rapidly evolving field.  \n- The failure of the Beresheet lunar lander is an outlier, not representative of the private sector as a whole. SpaceX\u2019s Falcon rockets, for instance, have a 98% success rate, demonstrating reliability.  \n- The FAA\u2019s regulatory challenges are not inherent to private sector activities but rather reflect the need for governments to adapt their regulatory frameworks\u2014an argument that supports our motion.  \n**Impact:** This point is critical because it challenges the opposition\u2019s claim that private sector activities are inherently unaccountable, weakening their argument for direct government operation.  \n\n---\n\n**CLASH POINT 3**  \n**Original Claim:** \"Transitioning to a regulatory role would undermine governments\u2019 ability to lead in space exploration and innovation.\"  \n**Challenge Type:** Counter Principle  \n**Challenge:**  \nThe principle that governments must directly operate space activities to lead is outdated and ignores the evolving nature of space exploration.  \n- Governments can lead through regulation and collaboration with the private sector, as seen in NASA\u2019s Commercial Crew Program, which has successfully partnered with SpaceX and Boeing.  \n- Private companies are not solely focused on short-term projects; SpaceX\u2019s Starship program aims for Mars colonization, aligning with long-term exploration goals.  \n- A regulatory role frees governments to invest in cutting-edge research while private companies handle operational costs, creating a more sustainable model for innovation.  \n**Impact:** Winning this point is essential because it demonstrates that governments can maintain leadership without direct operation, supporting the motion\u2019s claim that regulation is the better approach.  \n\n---\n\n**DEFENSIVE ANALYSIS**  \n**Vulnerabilities:**  \n- The proposition could be challenged on the feasibility of implementing effective regulatory frameworks quickly enough to address emerging space challenges.  \n- The opposition might argue that historical government-led achievements (e.g., Apollo program) prove the necessity of direct operation, which we must counter with modern examples of successful public-private partnerships.  \n**Additional Support:**  \n- Highlight successful regulatory models in other industries, such as aviation, to show that regulation can ensure safety and accountability without direct operation.  \n- Emphasize the cost-effectiveness of private sector innovation, which aligns with public interest by reducing the financial burden on taxpayers.  \n**Why We Prevail:**  \nOur arguments directly address the opposition\u2019s concerns and provide a more efficient and sustainable model for space activities. Regulation allows governments to leverage private sector strengths while maintaining oversight, creating a win-win scenario.  \n\n---\n\n**WEIGHING**  \n**Key Clash Points:**  \n- The debate hinges on whether regulation can achieve national security and innovation goals more effectively than direct operation.  \n**Why We Win:**  \nWe show that regulation is not only feasible but superior, as it allows governments to focus on their strengths (oversight) while harnessing the private sector\u2019s efficiency (innovation).  \n**Overall Impact:**  \nOur case demonstrates that transitioning to a regulatory role maximizes societal benefits, making it the better approach for the future of space activities.  \n\n---\n\n",
      "closing": "### FINAL SPEECH STRUCTURE\n\n**FRAMING**  \n**Core Questions:**  \n- The fundamental issue in this debate is whether governments can better serve public interest by transitioning from direct operation to regulation and oversight of private sector space activities.  \n- The key decision revolves around which approach\u2014direct operation or regulation\u2014better ensures national security, innovation, and accountability in space exploration.  \n- This debate should be evaluated based on efficiency, public interest, and the ability to foster sustainable advancements in space technology.  \n\n**KEY CLASHES**  \n\n**CLASH 1: National Security and Strategic Autonomy**  \n**Quote:** \"The principle of national security and strategic autonomy necessitates that governments retain direct control over space operations.\"  \n**Our Case Strength:**  \n- We argued that robust regulatory frameworks can achieve national security goals without direct operation. The U.S. Federal Communications Commission (FCC) already regulates satellite launches to align with national interests, demonstrating that oversight is sufficient.  \n- The principle of comparative advantage shows that private companies are better at operational roles, while governments excel at oversight. This division of labor ensures efficiency without compromising security.  \n**Their Response Gaps:**  \n- The opposition failed to prove that regulation cannot ensure strategic autonomy. Their claim that operational roles are necessary for oversight is unsubstantiated, as regulation can be just as effective with proper frameworks.  \n**Crucial Impact:**  \n- Winning this clash is pivotal because it undermines the opposition\u2019s core argument for direct government operation and establishes regulation as a viable, efficient alternative.  \n\n**CLASH 2: Accountability and Transparency in Private Sector Activities**  \n**Quote:** \"Private sector space activities lack the accountability and transparency required for critical space operations.\"  \n**Our Case Strength:**  \n- We demonstrated that private companies, like SpaceX, have worked with international bodies (e.g., ITU) to address orbital congestion, showing accountability.  \n- The failure of the Beresheet lunar lander was an outlier, not indicative of systemic issues. SpaceX\u2019s Falcon rockets have a 98% success rate, proving reliability.  \n**Their Response Gaps:**  \n- The opposition ignored the adaptability of regulatory frameworks. While the FAA faces challenges, these are growing pains, not inherent flaws in private sector oversight.  \n**Crucial Impact:**  \n- Winning this clash is critical because it shows that private sector activities are not inherently unaccountable and that regulation can address concerns effectively.  \n\n**CLASH 3: Leadership in Space Exploration and Innovation**  \n**Quote:** \"Transitioning to a regulatory role would undermine governments\u2019 ability to lead in space exploration and innovation.\"  \n**Our Case Strength:**  \n- We countered this by showing that governments can lead through collaboration, as seen in NASA\u2019s Commercial Crew Program with SpaceX and Boeing.  \n- Private companies like SpaceX are not solely focused on short-term projects; the Starship program aims for Mars colonization, aligning with long-term exploration goals.  \n**Their Response Gaps:**  \n- The opposition failed to address how public-private partnerships can enhance leadership without direct government operation. Their reliance on historical examples (e.g., Apollo program) ignores the evolving nature of space exploration.  \n**Crucial Impact:**  \n- Winning this clash is essential because it proves that governments can maintain leadership without direct operation, ensuring innovation and progress.  \n\n**VOTING ISSUES**  \n\n**Priority Analysis:**  \n- The key clashes revolve around national security, accountability, and leadership. These are the most critical issues because they define the core functions of governments in space activities.  \n- Our responses to these clashes demonstrate that regulation can achieve these goals more efficiently than direct operation, making them the deciding factors in this debate.  \n\n**Case Proof:**  \n- Winning the national security clash shows that regulation ensures strategic autonomy.  \n- Winning the accountability clash proves that private sector activities are not inherently unaccountable and that regulation can address concerns.  \n- Winning the leadership clash demonstrates that governments can lead through collaboration and oversight, fostering innovation.  \n- Together, these points prove that transitioning to a regulatory role is the better approach for governments in space activities.  \n\n**Final Weighing:**  \n- Even if the opposition wins minor points, our wins on national security, accountability, and leadership are decisive. These clashes are central to the debate, and our arguments are stronger.  \n- The overall impact of our case is clear: regulation allows governments to focus on their strengths (oversight) while leveraging the private sector\u2019s efficiency (innovation), creating a sustainable model for space activities.  \n\n---\n\n"

      "opening": "### OPENING SPEECH STRUCTURE\n\n**Core Claim:** Governments should maintain their primary role in direct operation of space activities rather than transitioning to regulation and oversight of private sector space activities.  \n**Support Type:** Principle  \n**Support Details:**  \n- The principle of national security and strategic autonomy necessitates that governments retain direct control over space operations. Space is a critical domain for defense, communication, and surveillance, and ceding control to private entities could compromise national security.  \n- Private companies are driven by profit motives, which may conflict with public interest and long-term strategic goals. Governments, as representatives of the public, are better positioned to prioritize these interests.  \n- The complexity and risks associated with space activities, such as orbital debris management and international treaties, require centralized governmental oversight and operation to ensure compliance and safety.  \n**Connection:** This principle demonstrates that direct government operation is essential to safeguard national security, public interest, and global space governance, which cannot be adequately ensured through mere regulation of private entities.\n\n---\n\n**Core Claim:** Private sector space activities lack the accountability and transparency required for critical space operations.  \n**Support Type:** Evidence  \n**Support Details:**  \n- Examples from the private sector, such as SpaceX\u2019s Starlink project, have raised concerns about orbital congestion and lack of transparency in decision-making. In 2021, SpaceX launched satellites without adequate consultation with international bodies, leading to protests from astronomers and other stakeholders.  \n- Private companies often prioritize speed and cost-efficiency over safety and long-term sustainability. For instance, the 2019 failure of a private lunar lander (Beresheet) highlighted the risks of relying on private entities for high-stakes missions.  \n- Regulatory frameworks for private space activities are still underdeveloped, as seen in the U.S. Federal Aviation Administration\u2019s (FAA) struggles to keep pace with the rapid growth of commercial spaceflight.  \n**Connection:** These examples show that private sector space activities are prone to mismanagement and lack the accountability needed for critical operations, making direct government involvement essential.\n\n---\n\n**Core Claim:** Transitioning to a regulatory role would undermine governments\u2019 ability to lead in space exploration and innovation.  \n**Support Type:** Principle  \n**Support Details:**  \n- Governments have historically been the primary drivers of space exploration, as seen in NASA\u2019s Apollo program and the International Space Station (ISS). These achievements were possible because of direct government investment and operation.  \n- Private companies often focus on short-term, commercially viable projects rather than long-term scientific exploration. For example, while private companies are developing space tourism, governments are leading missions to Mars and beyond.  \n- A regulatory role would reduce governments\u2019 capacity to invest in cutting-edge research and development, as resources would be diverted to oversight rather than innovation.  \n**Connection:** This principle highlights that direct government operation is crucial for maintaining leadership in space exploration and ensuring continued scientific and technological advancements.\n\n---\n\n**SYNTHESIS**  \nThese arguments collectively demonstrate that governments must retain their primary role in direct space operations. National security, accountability, and leadership in exploration are critical priorities that cannot be adequately addressed through regulation of private sector activities. The risks of ceding control to profit-driven entities outweigh the potential benefits, and governments must continue to lead in this vital domain to ensure the long-term sustainability and success of space activities.\n\n---\n\n",
      "rebuttal": "### REBUTTAL SPEECH STRUCTURE  \n\n**CLASH POINT 1**  \n**Original Claim:** \"The principle of comparative advantage suggests that governments are better suited to regulatory roles than operational roles in space.\"  \n**Challenge Type:** Principle Critique  \n**Challenge:**  \nThe principle of comparative advantage is misapplied here. While it is true that governments may have strengths in regulation, the unique nature of space activities requires direct operational involvement. Space is a domain where national security, scientific exploration, and global governance intersect, and these responsibilities cannot be effectively delegated to private entities. Governments, as representatives of public interest, are uniquely positioned to balance these priorities. Moreover, operational expertise in space is not mutually exclusive with regulatory capability\u2014many government agencies, such as NASA, have demonstrated both. Transitioning solely to a regulatory role would strip governments of the operational experience needed to oversee and regulate effectively.  \n**Impact:** Winning this point undermines the foundational principle of Proposition\u2019s case, showing that governments must retain operational roles to address the unique challenges of space.  \n\n---\n\n**CLASH POINT 2**  \n**Original Claim:** \"SpaceX\u2019s development of reusable rockets significantly reduced launch costs, a feat not achieved by government-led programs like NASA\u2019s Space Shuttle.\"  \n**Challenge Type:** Evidence Critique  \n**Challenge:**  \nWhile SpaceX\u2019s achievements are notable, they do not justify a wholesale transition to private sector dominance. The success of SpaceX relied heavily on government support, including NASA contracts and funding. Additionally, government programs like the Apollo missions achieved groundbreaking milestones that private companies have yet to match, showing that government-led operations are not inherently inefficient. Furthermore, the cost reductions achieved by SpaceX come with trade-offs, such as orbital congestion and lack of transparency, as seen with the Starlink project. These issues highlight the risks of over-reliance on private entities.  \n**Impact:** Defeating this claim demonstrates that private sector success is not independent of government support and that government-led operations remain critical for addressing broader public interests.  \n\n---\n\n**CLASH POINT 3**  \n**Original Claim:** \"Government oversight ensures that innovation occurs responsibly, without compromising safety or ethical standards.\"  \n**Challenge Type:** Counter Evidence  \n**Challenge:**  \nThe evidence shows that current regulatory frameworks are inadequate to ensure responsible innovation. For example, the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) has struggled to keep pace with the rapid growth of commercial spaceflight, leading to gaps in oversight. Private companies, driven by profit motives, have prioritized speed and cost-efficiency over safety, as seen in the failure of the Beresheet lunar lander. Without direct operational involvement, governments lack the technical expertise and hands-on experience needed to create effective regulations. Thus, regulation alone cannot ensure responsible innovation.  \n**Impact:** This directly counters Proposition\u2019s claim that regulation is sufficient, showing that operational involvement is necessary to develop robust oversight frameworks.  \n\n---\n\n**DEFENSIVE ANALYSIS**  \n**Vulnerabilities:**  \n- Proposition may argue that governments can develop regulatory expertise without operational involvement.  \n- They could emphasize the cost savings and efficiency gains from private sector innovation.  \n**Additional Support:**  \n- Highlight historical examples of government-led successes, such as the Apollo program, which achieved milestones that private companies have yet to match.  \n- Emphasize the risks of orbital debris and the need for centralized government management to address these challenges.  \n**Why We Prevail:**  \nOur arguments demonstrate that governments must retain operational roles to address the unique challenges of space, while Proposition\u2019s case relies on flawed applications of principles and incomplete evidence.  \n\n---\n\n**WEIGHING**  \n**Key Clash Points:**  \n- The necessity of operational roles for national security and global governance.  \n- The inadequacy of current regulatory frameworks to ensure responsible innovation.  \n**Why We Win:**  \nOur arguments address the broader implications of space activities, including national security, public interest, and global governance, which Proposition\u2019s case fails to adequately consider.  \n**Overall Impact:**  \nWinning these key points proves that governments must maintain their primary role in direct space operations to ensure the long-term sustainability and success of space activities.  \n\n",
      "closing": "### FRAMING  \nThe core issue in this debate is whether governments should prioritize regulation and oversight of private sector space activities over direct operation. This decision fundamentally hinges on two key questions: \n1. Can regulation adequately address national security, public interest, and global governance concerns in space?  \n2. Is the private sector capable of handling the complexities and risks of space operations without direct government involvement?  \n\nThe debate should be evaluated based on which side better balances the need for control, accountability, and innovation in space activities. We argue that direct government operation remains essential to safeguard national security, ensure transparency, and maintain leadership in exploration.  \n\n---\n\n### KEY CLASHES  \n\n**Clash 1: National Security and Strategic Autonomy**  \n**Quote:** Proposition: \"Regulation can achieve national security goals more effectively than direct operation.\"  \n**Our Case Strength:**  \nDirect government operation ensures that space activities align with national security priorities, which cannot be fully delegated to private entities. Space is a critical domain for defense, communications, and surveillance, and ceding operational control risks compromising sovereignty.  \n**Their Response Gaps:**  \nProposition suggests that regulation can maintain strategic autonomy, but this ignores the technical expertise required to oversee space activities. Without direct involvement, governments lack the hands-on experience needed to regulate effectively.  \n**Crucial Impact:**  \nNational security is non-negotiable; maintaining direct operation is essential to protect public interest and sovereignty in space.  \n\n**Clash 2: Accountability and Transparency**  \n**Quote:** Proposition: \"Regulation ensures private sector innovation occurs responsibly.\"  \n**Our Case Strength:**  \nPrivate companies often prioritize profit over public interest, as seen in SpaceX\u2019s Starlink project, which launched satellites without adequate consultation, causing orbital congestion. Government-led operations are inherently more accountable to the public.  \n**Their Response Gaps:**  \nProposition claims that regulation can ensure accountability, but current frameworks are inadequate. The FAA\u2019s struggles to regulate commercial spaceflight demonstrate this gap.  \n**Crucial Impact:**  \nAccountability is critical in space activities, where mismanagement can have global consequences. Direct government operation is the only way to ensure transparency.  \n\n**Clash 3: Leadership in Innovation and Exploration**  \n**Quote:** Proposition: \"A regulatory role allows governments to focus on cutting-edge research.\"  \n**Our Case Strength:**  \nHistorically, governments have driven major breakthroughs in space exploration, such as the Apollo program and the ISS. Private companies often focus on commercially viable projects, neglecting long-term scientific goals.  \n**Their Response Gaps:**  \nProposition argues that public-private partnerships can maintain leadership, but these partnerships still rely on government funding and oversight. Without direct operation, governments lose their ability to drive innovation independently.  \n**Crucial Impact:**  \nLeadership in space exploration is essential for scientific progress and global influence. Direct government operation ensures that long-term goals are prioritized.  \n\n---\n\n### VOTING ISSUES  \n\n**Priority Analysis:**  \nThe most critical clash is national security, as it directly impacts sovereignty and public interest. Accountability and leadership in innovation tie closely to this, as they ensure that space activities benefit society as a whole.  \n\n**Case Proof:**  \nWinning these key points proves that governments must retain direct operation to safeguard national security, ensure accountability, and maintain leadership in exploration. Proposition\u2019s case fails to address these priorities adequately through regulation alone.  \n\n**Final Weighing:**  \nEven if Proposition wins on efficiency or innovation, these benefits are outweighed by the risks to national security, accountability, and long-term exploration. Governments must remain directly involved in space operations to ensure the sustainable and responsible development of this critical domain.  \n\n---\n\n"

The evidence from SpaceX\u2019s success is concrete and directly supports the claim that private sector involvement leads to faster advancements. Additionally, the principle of comparative advantage provides a logical framework for why governments are better suited to regulation than operation. These points are well-supported and align with the judging criteria of evidence quality and logical validity.  \n\nHowever, my opponent (another version of me) could argue that governments must maintain operational roles to ensure national security and prevent monopolization of space by private entities. They might also highlight the risks of inadequate regulation, such as environmental damage or conflicts in space. If they present specific examples of government-led successes (e.g., the International Space Station) and emphasize the potential dangers of privatization, they could make a compelling case.  \n\nGiven the strength of my arguments and the potential counterarguments, I estimate a 65% chance of winning."
