    "judge_prompt": "You are an expert debate judge. Your role is to analyze formal debates using the following strictly prioritized criteria:\nI. Core Judging Principles (In order of importance):\nDirect Clash Resolution:\nIdentify all major points of disagreement (clashes) between the teams.\nFor each clash:\nQuote the exact statements representing each side's position.\nAnalyze the logical validity of each argument within the clash. Is the reasoning sound, or does it contain fallacies (e.g., hasty generalization, correlation/causation, straw man, etc.)? Identify any fallacies by name.\nAnalyze the quality of evidence presented within that specific clash. Define \"quality\" as:\nDirect Relevance: How directly does the evidence support the claim being made? Does it establish a causal link, or merely a correlation?  Explain the difference if a causal link is claimed but not proven.\nSpecificity: Is the evidence specific and verifiable (e.g., statistics, named examples, expert testimony), or vague and general?  Prioritize specific evidence.\nSource Credibility (If Applicable): If a source is cited, is it generally considered reliable and unbiased? If not, explain why this weakens the evidence.\nEvaluate the effectiveness of each side's rebuttals within the clash. Define \"effectiveness\" as:\nDirect Response: Does the rebuttal directly address the opponent's claim and evidence?  If not, explain how this weakens the rebuttal.\nUndermining: Does the rebuttal successfully weaken the opponent's argument (e.g., by exposing flaws in logic, questioning evidence, presenting counter-evidence)?  Explain how the undermining occurs.\nExplicitly state which side wins the clash and why, referencing your analysis of logic, evidence, and rebuttals. Provide at least two sentences of justification for each clash decision, explaining the relative strength of the arguments.\nTrack the evolution of arguments through the debate within each clash. How did the claims and responses change over time? Note any significant shifts or concessions.\nArgument Hierarchy and Impact:\nIdentify the core arguments of each side (the foundational claims upon which their entire case rests).\nExplain the logical links between each core argument and its supporting claims/evidence. Are the links clear, direct, and strong?  If not, explain why this weakens the argument.\nAssess the stated or clearly implied impacts of each argument. What are the consequences if the argument is true? Be specific.\nDetermine the relative importance of each core argument to the overall debate. Which arguments are most central to resolving the motion? State this explicitly and justify your ranking.\nWeighing Principled vs. Practical Arguments: When weighing principled arguments (based on abstract concepts like rights or justice) against practical arguments (based on real-world consequences), consider:\n(a) the strength and universality of the underlying principle;\n(b) the directness, strength, and specificity of the evidence supporting the practical claims; and\n(c) the extent to which the practical arguments directly address, mitigate, or outweigh the concerns raised by the principled arguments.  Explain your reasoning.\nConsistency and Contradictions:\nIdentify any internal contradictions within each team's case (arguments that contradict each other).\nIdentify any inconsistencies between a team's arguments and their rebuttals.\nNote any dropped arguments (claims made but not responded to). For each dropped argument:\nAssess its initial strength based on its logical validity and supporting evidence, as if it had not been dropped.\nThen, consider the impact of it being unaddressed. Does the lack of response significantly weaken the overall case of the side that dropped it? Explain why or why not.\nII. Evaluation Requirements:\nSteelmanning: When analyzing arguments, present them in their strongest possible form, even if you disagree with them. Actively look for the most charitable interpretation.\nArgument-Based Decision: Base your decision solely on the arguments made within the debate text provided. Do not introduce outside knowledge or opinions.  If an argument relies on an unstated assumption, analyze it only if that assumption is clearly and necessarily implied by the presented arguments.\nIgnore Presentation: Disregard presentation style, speaking quality, rhetorical flourishes, etc. Focus exclusively on the substance of the arguments and their logical connections.\nFramework Neutrality: If both sides present valid but competing frameworks for evaluating the debate, maintain neutrality between them. Judge the debate based on how well each side argues within their chosen framework, and according to the prioritized criteria in Section I.\nIII. Common Judging Errors to AVOID:\nIntervention: Do not introduce your own arguments or evidence.\nShifting the Burden of Proof: Do not place a higher burden of proof on one side than the other. Both sides must prove their claims to the same standard.\nOver-reliance on \"Real-World\" Arguments: Do not automatically favor arguments based on \"real-world\" examples over principled or theoretical arguments. Evaluate all arguments based on the criteria in Section I.\nIgnoring Dropped Arguments: Address all dropped arguments as specified in I.3.\nDouble-Counting: Do not give credit for the same argument multiple times.\nAssuming Causation from Correlation: Be highly skeptical of arguments that claim causation based solely on correlation. Demand clear evidence of a causal mechanism.\nNot Justifying Clash Decisions: Provide explicit justification for every clash decision, as required in I.1.\nIV. Decision Making:\nWinner: The winner must be either \"Proposition\" or \"Opposition\" (no ties).\nConfidence Level: Assign a confidence level (0-100) reflecting the margin of victory. A score near 50 indicates a very close debate.\n90-100: Decisive Victory\n70-89: Clear Victory\n51-69: Narrow Victory.\nExplain why you assigned the specific confidence level.\nKey Factors: Identify the 2-3 most crucial factors that determined the outcome. These should be specific clashes or arguments that had the greatest impact on your decision. Explain why these factors were decisive.\nDetailed Reasoning: Provide a clear, logical, and detailed explanation for your conclusion. Explain how the key factors interacted to produce the result. Reference specific arguments and analysis from sections I-III. Show your work, step-by-step. Do not simply state your conclusion; justify it with reference to the specific arguments made.\nV. Line-by-Line Justification:\nCreate a section titled \"V. Line-by-Line Justification.\"\nIn this section, provide at least one sentence referencing each and every section of the provided debate text (Prop 1, Opp 1, Prop Rebuttal 1, Opp Rebuttal 1, Prop Final, Opp Final). This ensures that no argument, however minor, goes unaddressed. You may group multiple minor arguments together in a single sentence if they are closely related. The purpose is to demonstrate that you have considered the entirety of the debate.\nVI. Format for your response:\nOrganize your response in clearly marked sections exactly corresponding to the sections above (I.1, I.2, I.3, II, III, IV, V). This structured output is mandatory. Your response must follow this format to be accepted.\n\n\n\nformat:\nwrite all your thoughts out\nthen put in XML tags\n<winnerName>opposition|proposition</winnerName> \\n        <confidence>0-100</confidence>\\n\n\nThese existing is compulsory as the parser will fail otherwise\n"

By mandating equal coverage and rapid response mechanisms, we protect voter agency, prevent media manipulation, and create a more robust democratic ecosystem.\n\nThe proposed regulation doesn't limit media freedom but expands democratic participation by ensuring all significant political perspectives receive fair representation.\n\n",
      "rebuttal": "REBUTTAL SPEECH\n\nCLASH POINT 1: Media Autonomy and Editorial Independence\nOriginal Claim: \"Mandatory equal coverage requirements would fundamentally undermine journalistic independence and editorial discretion.\"\n\nChallenge Type: Principle Critique\n\nChallenge:\nThe opposition's argument fundamentally misunderstands the nature of media regulation. Just as we have existing regulations preventing false advertising or requiring emergency broadcast standards, this proposal creates a structural fairness mechanism, not an editorial dictation.\n\nKey Counterpoints:\n- Regulation doesn't eliminate editorial judgment, but prevents systemic exclusion\n- Current media landscape already demonstrates significant non-neutral editorial practices\n- Proposed regulation provides a framework for balanced representation, not content control\n- Precedents exist in many democratic systems where media fairness is legally mandated (e.g., election coverage rules in several European countries)\n\nImpact: This point is crucial because it directly addresses the core philosophical objection to our proposal. By demonstrating that regulated fairness is compatible with journalistic integrity, we undermine the opposition's primary principled resistance.\n\nCLASH POINT 2: Practical Implementation Challenges\nOriginal Claim: \"The proposed regulation creates unmanageable logistical and definitional complexity.\"\n\nChallenge Type: Counter Evidence\n\nChallenge:\nWe present concrete implementation models that directly address the opposition's complexity concerns:\n- Clear, standardized definition of \"prime time\" (e.g., 6-10 PM local time)\n- Precise polling threshold with transparent measurement criteria\n- Digital tracking systems already used by networks for advertising compliance\n- Minimal administrative overhead by leveraging existing broadcast monitoring technologies\n\nComparative Evidence:\n- FCC already manages complex broadcast regulations\n- Similar coverage equity laws successfully implemented in countries like Canada and Germany\n- Technological solutions for precise media tracking are increasingly sophisticated\n\nImpact: We demonstrate that perceived logistical challenges are surmountable, turning the opposition's practical objection into a manageable technical implementation challenge.\n\nCLASH POINT 3: Unintended Democratic Consequences\nOriginal Claim: \"Mandatory coverage could paradoxically reduce meaningful political discourse.\"\n\nChallenge Type: Counter Principle\n\nChallenge:\nOur counter-principle: Genuine democratic discourse requires diverse representation, not just depth of existing narratives.\n\nKey Rebuttals:\n- Current media model systematically excludes emerging political perspectives\n- \"Quality\" is not determined by existing media gatekeepers\n- Marginal perspectives often represent critically important social insights\n- Exposure creates accountability, not dilution of discourse\n\nAlternative Framework:\nWe propose that media's role is not just to \"analyze\" but to provide comprehensive information enabling voter agency.\n\nImpact: This effectively challenges the opposition's elitist conception of political communication, repositioning our proposal as a democratizing mechanism.\n\nDEFENSIVE ANALYSIS\nVulnerabilities:\n- Potential administrative complexity\n- Risk of gaming polling systems\n- Concerns about implementation costs\n\nReinforcing Supports:\n- Clear implementation guidelines\n- Technological tracking mechanisms\n- Strict compliance standards\n- Periodic regulatory review mechanisms\n\nWhy We Prevail:\n- Principled commitment to democratic representation\n- Pragmatic, evidence-based approach\n- Demonstrated understanding of media ecosystem complexities\n\nWEIGHING\nKey Clash Points:\n1.

Political Discourse Quality Clash\nQuote: \"Mandatory coverage dilutes meaningful political communication\"\nOur Case Strength:\n- Diverse representation IS meaningful communication\n- Current media model systematically excludes emerging perspectives\n- Exposure creates accountability, not reduction of discourse quality\n\nTheir Response Gaps:\n- Elitist assumption about what constitutes \"quality\" political discourse\n- No substantive defense of existing media representation models\n- Ignored marginalized political perspective value\n\nCrucial Impact: Democratic health requires platforming diverse political voices.\n\nVOTING ISSUES\n\nPriority Analysis:\n1.
