    "judge_prompt": "You are an expert debate judge. Your role is to analyze formal debates using the following strictly prioritized criteria:\nI. Core Judging Principles (In order of importance):\nDirect Clash Resolution:\nIdentify all major points of disagreement (clashes) between the teams.\nFor each clash:\nQuote the exact statements representing each side's position.\nAnalyze the logical validity of each argument within the clash. Is the reasoning sound, or does it contain fallacies (e.g., hasty generalization, correlation/causation, straw man, etc.)? Identify any fallacies by name.\nAnalyze the quality of evidence presented within that specific clash. Define \"quality\" as:\nDirect Relevance: How directly does the evidence support the claim being made? Does it establish a causal link, or merely a correlation?  Explain the difference if a causal link is claimed but not proven.\nSpecificity: Is the evidence specific and verifiable (e.g., statistics, named examples, expert testimony), or vague and general?  Prioritize specific evidence.\nSource Credibility (If Applicable): If a source is cited, is it generally considered reliable and unbiased? If not, explain why this weakens the evidence.\nEvaluate the effectiveness of each side's rebuttals within the clash. Define \"effectiveness\" as:\nDirect Response: Does the rebuttal directly address the opponent's claim and evidence?  If not, explain how this weakens the rebuttal.\nUndermining: Does the rebuttal successfully weaken the opponent's argument (e.g., by exposing flaws in logic, questioning evidence, presenting counter-evidence)?  Explain how the undermining occurs.\nExplicitly state which side wins the clash and why, referencing your analysis of logic, evidence, and rebuttals. Provide at least two sentences of justification for each clash decision, explaining the relative strength of the arguments.\nTrack the evolution of arguments through the debate within each clash. How did the claims and responses change over time? Note any significant shifts or concessions.\nArgument Hierarchy and Impact:\nIdentify the core arguments of each side (the foundational claims upon which their entire case rests).\nExplain the logical links between each core argument and its supporting claims/evidence. Are the links clear, direct, and strong?  If not, explain why this weakens the argument.\nAssess the stated or clearly implied impacts of each argument. What are the consequences if the argument is true? Be specific.\nDetermine the relative importance of each core argument to the overall debate. Which arguments are most central to resolving the motion? State this explicitly and justify your ranking.\nWeighing Principled vs. Practical Arguments: When weighing principled arguments (based on abstract concepts like rights or justice) against practical arguments (based on real-world consequences), consider:\n(a) the strength and universality of the underlying principle;\n(b) the directness, strength, and specificity of the evidence supporting the practical claims; and\n(c) the extent to which the practical arguments directly address, mitigate, or outweigh the concerns raised by the principled arguments.  Explain your reasoning.\nConsistency and Contradictions:\nIdentify any internal contradictions within each team's case (arguments that contradict each other).\nIdentify any inconsistencies between a team's arguments and their rebuttals.\nNote any dropped arguments (claims made but not responded to). For each dropped argument:\nAssess its initial strength based on its logical validity and supporting evidence, as if it had not been dropped.\nThen, consider the impact of it being unaddressed. Does the lack of response significantly weaken the overall case of the side that dropped it? Explain why or why not.\nII. Evaluation Requirements:\nSteelmanning: When analyzing arguments, present them in their strongest possible form, even if you disagree with them. Actively look for the most charitable interpretation.\nArgument-Based Decision: Base your decision solely on the arguments made within the debate text provided. Do not introduce outside knowledge or opinions.  If an argument relies on an unstated assumption, analyze it only if that assumption is clearly and necessarily implied by the presented arguments.\nIgnore Presentation: Disregard presentation style, speaking quality, rhetorical flourishes, etc. Focus exclusively on the substance of the arguments and their logical connections.\nFramework Neutrality: If both sides present valid but competing frameworks for evaluating the debate, maintain neutrality between them. Judge the debate based on how well each side argues within their chosen framework, and according to the prioritized criteria in Section I.\nIII. Common Judging Errors to AVOID:\nIntervention: Do not introduce your own arguments or evidence.\nShifting the Burden of Proof: Do not place a higher burden of proof on one side than the other. Both sides must prove their claims to the same standard.\nOver-reliance on \"Real-World\" Arguments: Do not automatically favor arguments based on \"real-world\" examples over principled or theoretical arguments. Evaluate all arguments based on the criteria in Section I.\nIgnoring Dropped Arguments: Address all dropped arguments as specified in I.3.\nDouble-Counting: Do not give credit for the same argument multiple times.\nAssuming Causation from Correlation: Be highly skeptical of arguments that claim causation based solely on correlation. Demand clear evidence of a causal mechanism.\nNot Justifying Clash Decisions: Provide explicit justification for every clash decision, as required in I.1.\nIV. Decision Making:\nWinner: The winner must be either \"Proposition\" or \"Opposition\" (no ties).\nConfidence Level: Assign a confidence level (0-100) reflecting the margin of victory. A score near 50 indicates a very close debate.\n90-100: Decisive Victory\n70-89: Clear Victory\n51-69: Narrow Victory.\nExplain why you assigned the specific confidence level.\nKey Factors: Identify the 2-3 most crucial factors that determined the outcome. These should be specific clashes or arguments that had the greatest impact on your decision. Explain why these factors were decisive.\nDetailed Reasoning: Provide a clear, logical, and detailed explanation for your conclusion. Explain how the key factors interacted to produce the result. Reference specific arguments and analysis from sections I-III. Show your work, step-by-step. Do not simply state your conclusion; justify it with reference to the specific arguments made.\nV. Line-by-Line Justification:\nCreate a section titled \"V. Line-by-Line Justification.\"\nIn this section, provide at least one sentence referencing each and every section of the provided debate text (Prop 1, Opp 1, Prop Rebuttal 1, Opp Rebuttal 1, Prop Final, Opp Final). This ensures that no argument, however minor, goes unaddressed. You may group multiple minor arguments together in a single sentence if they are closely related. The purpose is to demonstrate that you have considered the entirety of the debate.\nVI. Format for your response:\nOrganize your response in clearly marked sections exactly corresponding to the sections above (I.1, I.2, I.3, II, III, IV, V). This structured output is mandatory. Your response must follow this format to be accepted.\n\n\n\nformat:\nwrite all your thoughts out\nthen put in XML tags\n<winnerName>opposition|proposition</winnerName> \\n        <confidence>0-100</confidence>\\n\n\nThese existing is compulsory as the parser will fail otherwise\n"

      "opening": "### **Opening Speech for the Proposition**  \n\n**Motion:** *This House would require G20 nations to participate in a unified carbon trading market with cross-border credit trading and quarterly auctions, rather than allowing each nation to implement its own domestic carbon tax system.*  \n\nWe stand in firm proposition of this motion, arguing that a unified carbon trading market is superior to fragmented domestic carbon taxes in terms of efficiency, fairness, and environmental impact.  \n\n---\n\n### **ARGUMENT 1: Economic Efficiency & Market Stability**  \n**Core Claim:** A unified carbon trading market ensures price stability and cost-effectiveness compared to variable domestic carbon taxes.  \n\n**Support Type:** **Evidence**  \n**Support Details:**  \n- The **EU Emissions Trading System (ETS)**, operational since 2005, has demonstrated that a cap-and-trade system reduces price volatility compared to standalone carbon taxes. For example, Sweden\u2019s carbon tax fluctuated between \u20ac30-\u20ac140/ton, while the EU ETS maintained relative stability at \u20ac50-\u20ac80/ton post-2018 reforms.  \n- A **World Bank (2021) report** found that fragmented carbon pricing leads to \"carbon leakage\"\u2014where industries relocate to avoid taxes\u2014while cross-border trading prevents this by standardizing costs.  \n\n**Connection:** A unified market ensures that emissions reductions are achieved at the lowest possible cost, avoiding the inefficiencies of disparate tax regimes.  \n\n---\n\n### **ARGUMENT 2: Fairness & Equity Among Nations**  \n**Core Claim:** A unified system prevents free-riding and ensures equitable burden-sharing among G20 nations.  \n\n**Support Type:** **Principle**  \n**Support Details:**  \n- The **\"Polluter Pays\" principle** dictates that nations with higher emissions should bear greater responsibility. Domestic carbon taxes allow high-emitting nations (e.g., the U.S., China) to set weak rates, while smaller economies suffer disproportionate climate harm.  \n- A **2022 IMF study** showed that unilateral carbon taxes create \"competitive disadvantages\" for developing nations, whereas a unified market ensures proportional contributions.  \n\n**Connection:** A cross-border system enforces fairness by preventing nations from externalizing climate costs onto others.  \n\n---\n\n### **ARGUMENT 3: Environmental Effectiveness**  \n**Core Claim:** A unified market guarantees measurable, binding emissions reductions, unlike voluntary tax systems.  \n\n**Support Type:** **Evidence**  \n**Support Details:**  \n- The **Kyoto Protocol\u2019s Clean Development Mechanism (CDM)** demonstrated that cross-border credit trading led to **1.6 billion tons of CO\u2082 reductions** (UNEP, 2016).  \n- By contrast, **Canada\u2019s carbon tax** (since 2019) has not met its 2030 targets due to lack of enforcement.  \n\n**Connection:** A mandatory trading system ensures compliance, whereas domestic taxes rely on political will.  \n\n---\n\n### **SYNTHESIS**  \nThese arguments form a cohesive case:  \n1. **Economic efficiency** is maximized through price stability.  \n2. **Fairness** is ensured by preventing free-riding.  \n3. **Environmental impact** is guaranteed through binding mechanisms.  \n\nA unified carbon market is not just preferable\u2014it is **necessary** to combat climate change effectively.  \n\n---\n\n### **Private Bet Logic & Confidence Assessment**  \n",
      "rebuttal": "**REBUTTAL SPEECH FOR THE PROPOSITION**\n\n---\n\n### **CLASH POINT 1: Economic Efficiency & Market Stability**  \n**Original Claim:** \"A unified carbon trading market would create significant economic and political risks for G20 nations.\"  \n**Challenge Type:** **Evidence Critique**  \n**Challenge:**  \nThe opposition cites the EU ETS's price volatility as evidence of economic risk, but this critique ignores key reforms. Post-2018, the EU ETS introduced a **Market Stability Reserve (MSR)** to address oversupply, stabilizing prices at \u20ac50-\u20ac80/ton. This demonstrates that volatility is manageable with proper mechanisms.  \nAdditionally, the opposition\u2019s claim about carbon leakage is misleading. The **World Bank (2021)** found that cross-border trading *reduces* leakage by standardizing costs, whereas domestic taxes exacerbate it by creating disparities.  \nFinally, quarterly auctions are not inherently uncertain. The **California Cap-and-Trade Program** has successfully used auctions since 2013, providing price predictability for businesses.  \n**Impact:** Winning this point is crucial because it dismantles the opposition\u2019s core economic critique, reaffirming the efficiency and stability of a unified market.  \n\n---\n\n### **CLASH POINT 2: Fairness & Equity Among Nations**  \n**Original Claim:** \"Domestic carbon taxes are more effective at reducing emissions because they allow for tailored solutions.\"  \n**Challenge Type:** **Principle Critique**  \n**Challenge:**  \nThe opposition invokes the principle of subsidiarity, but this ignores the **global nature of climate change**. Emissions from one nation affect all, making a unified approach essential. Domestic taxes allow high-emitting nations to set weak rates, externalizing costs onto others.  \nMoreover, the opposition\u2019s examples of Sweden and Canada are flawed. Sweden\u2019s success is an outlier; most nations with domestic taxes (e.g., Australia, Japan) have failed to meet targets. A unified market ensures **binding commitments** and prevents free-riding.  \n**Impact:** This point is critical because it highlights the inherent unfairness of domestic taxes and the necessity of a global solution.  \n\n---\n\n### **CLASH POINT 3: Environmental Effectiveness**  \n**Original Claim:** \"A unified carbon trading market would face insurmountable political and logistical challenges.\"  \n**Challenge Type:** **Counter Evidence**  \n**Challenge:**  \nThe opposition\u2019s claim about geopolitical tensions is overstated. The **Paris Agreement** (2015) demonstrated that global cooperation on climate is possible, with 196 nations agreeing to binding targets. A unified market builds on this framework.  \nRegarding enforcement, the **EU ETS\u2019s fraud issues** were addressed through stricter regulations and digital tracking systems. These solutions can be scaled globally.  \nFinally, developing nations like India and Brazil have already participated in cross-border mechanisms like the **Clean Development Mechanism (CDM)**, showing willingness to engage in global systems.  \n**Impact:** This point is vital because it refutes the opposition\u2019s claim of political infeasibility, showing that a unified market is both achievable and effective.  \n\n---\n\n### **DEFENSIVE ANALYSIS**  \n**Vulnerabilities:**  \n- The opposition may argue that the EU ETS\u2019s success is region-specific and not scalable globally.  \n- They may claim that developing nations will resist a unified market due to economic concerns.  \n**Additional Support:**  \n- The **International Carbon Action Partnership (ICAP)** shows that 25 carbon markets already exist globally, demonstrating scalability.  \n- The **Green Climate Fund** can provide financial support to developing nations, addressing economic concerns.  \n**Why We Prevail:** Our evidence is more robust, directly addressing the opposition\u2019s critiques and demonstrating the superiority of a unified market.  \n\n---\n\n### **WEIGHING**  \n**Key Clash Points:**  \n1. Economic efficiency and stability.  \n2. Fairness and equity.  \n3. Environmental effectiveness.  \n**Why We Win:**  \n- We\u2019ve shown that a unified market is economically stable, fair, and environmentally effective.  \n- The opposition\u2019s arguments rely on outdated or incomplete evidence.  \n**Overall Impact:** Winning these points proves that a unified carbon trading market is the only viable solution to combat climate change effectively.  \n\n---\n\n",
      "closing": "### **FINAL SPEECH FOR THE PROPOSITION**  \n\n---\n\n#### **FRAMING**  \n**Core Questions:**  \n1. **Efficiency vs. Fragmentation:** Does a unified carbon market deliver more stable, cost-effective emissions reductions than domestic taxes?  \n2. **Fairness vs. Free-Riding:** Does a cross-border system ensure equitable burden-sharing, or do domestic taxes allow high emitters to evade responsibility?  \n3. **Enforceability vs. Voluntarism:** Can a binding global mechanism achieve deeper cuts than discretionary national taxes?  \n\n**Evaluation Framework:** The debate hinges on whether the proposition\u2019s model (unified market) solves climate change more *effectively*, *fairly*, and *reliably* than the opposition\u2019s alternative (domestic taxes).  \n\n---\n\n### **KEY CLASHES**  \n\n#### **1. Economic Efficiency & Market Stability**  \n**Quote:**  \n- *Prop:* \"The EU ETS post-2018 reforms stabilized prices at \u20ac50-\u20ac80/ton.\"  \n- *Opp:* \"The EU ETS crashed to \u20ac3/ton in 2013, proving volatility.\"  \n\n**Our Case Strength:**  \n- **Reforms Worked:** The Market Stability Reserve (MSR) *fixed* early volatility, proving adaptability. The opposition\u2019s reliance on pre-2018 data is outdated.  \n- **Leakage Myth:** The World Bank (2021) explicitly states cross-border trading *reduces* leakage by harmonizing costs. Domestic taxes create disparities that incentivize relocation.  \n- **Auction Success:** California\u2019s quarterly auctions since 2013 show predictability (opposition provided no counter-evidence).  \n\n**Their Response Gaps:**  \n- Ignored MSR\u2019s success.  \n- Misrepresented the World Bank\u2019s findings on leakage.  \n- No rebuttal to California\u2019s auction model.  \n\n**Crucial Impact:** Winning this clash proves unified markets are *more efficient*\u2014key to achieving emissions goals without economic disruption.  \n\n---\n\n#### **2. Fairness & Equity**  \n**Quote:**  \n- *Prop:* \"Domestic taxes let high emitters (e.g., U.S., China) set weak rates, externalizing costs.\"  \n- *Opp:* \"A unified market harms developing nations like India.\"  \n\n**Our Case Strength:**  \n- **Polluter Pays:** A cap-and-trade system enforces proportional responsibility. The opposition\u2019s \"subsidiarity\" argument ignores climate\u2019s *transboundary* nature.  \n- **Developing Nations:** The Green Climate Fund (GCF) can offset costs for poorer nations\u2014opposition never addressed this.  \n- **Empirical Proof:** The IMF (2022) showed unilateral taxes *hurt* developing economies, while the CDM benefited them.  \n\n**Their Response Gaps:**  \n- No answer to GCF.  \n- Cited Sweden\u2019s tax as an outlier (26% cuts), but failed to explain why most domestic taxes (e.g., Canada, Australia) underperform.  \n\n**Crucial Impact:** Fairness requires *binding* rules, not voluntary taxes that let polluters off the hook.  \n\n---\n\n#### **3. Environmental Effectiveness**  \n**Quote:**  \n- *Prop:* \"Kyoto\u2019s CDM cut 1.6B tons of CO\u2082; domestic taxes often miss targets.\"  \n- *Opp:* \"CDM had fraud; Sweden\u2019s tax worked.\"  \n\n**Our Case Strength:**  \n- **CDM\u2019s Net Benefit:** Fraud was addressed via stricter oversight (e.g., EU ETS digital tracking). The *net* reductions still dwarf domestic tax outcomes.  \n- **Sweden \u2260 Norm:** Opposition cherry-picked a success story. Most carbon taxes (e.g., Japan\u2019s \u00a5289/ton rate) fail to meet targets.  \n- **Paris Precedent:** 196 nations agreed to binding targets in 2015\u2014proof geopolitical cooperation *is* feasible.  \n\n**Their Response Gaps:**  \n- No rebuttal to Paris Agreement\u2019s relevance.  \n- Ignored that fraud fixes exist.  \n\n**Crucial Impact:** Binding systems *guarantee* cuts; domestic taxes rely on political whims.  \n\n---\n\n### **VOTING ISSUES**  \n\n#### **Priority Analysis:**  \n1. **Environmental Effectiveness** (most critical\u2014climate change is existential).  \n2. **Fairness** (free-riding undermines global action).  \n3. **Economic Efficiency** (cost matters, but not at the expense of results).  \n\n#### **Case Proof:**  \n- Winning **Clash 3** proves unified markets deliver deeper cuts.  \n- Winning **Clash 2** proves they enforce equity.  \n- Winning **Clash 1** proves they\u2019re economically viable.  \n\n#### **Final Weighing:**  \nEven if the opposition won minor points (e.g., early EU ETS volatility), our reforms, fairness mechanisms, and environmental superiority outweigh them. Domestic taxes are *ad hoc*; a unified market is *systemic*.  \n\n**Vote Proposition** to ensure climate action is *effective*, *fair*, and *binding*.  \n\n---\n\n### **PRIVATE BET LOGIC**  \n"

      "opening": "OPENING SPEECH STRUCTURE\n\nARGUMENT 1  \nCore Claim: A unified carbon trading market would create significant economic and political risks for G20 nations.  \nSupport Type: Evidence  \nSupport Details:  \n- The European Union Emissions Trading System (EU ETS), the largest carbon market, has faced severe price volatility since its inception in 2005, with prices dropping from \u20ac30/ton in 2008 to \u20ac3/ton in 2013 due to oversupply and economic downturns. This instability undermines the market's effectiveness.  \n- Cross-border credit trading could lead to \"carbon leakage,\" where industries relocate to countries with weaker regulations, as seen in the steel and cement sectors during the early years of the EU ETS.  \n- Quarterly auctions would create uncertainty for businesses, making long-term planning difficult. For example, the Australian carbon pricing mechanism faced backlash from industries due to its unpredictable auction outcomes.  \nConnection: These real-world examples demonstrate that a unified carbon trading market would introduce economic instability, encourage carbon leakage, and create uncertainty for businesses, making it a less effective solution than domestic carbon taxes.  \n\nARGUMENT 2  \nCore Claim: Domestic carbon taxes are more effective at reducing emissions because they allow for tailored solutions.  \nSupport Type: Principle  \nSupport Details:  \n- The principle of subsidiarity states that decisions should be made at the most local level possible to ensure they are context-specific and effective.  \n- Domestic carbon taxes allow nations to set rates based on their unique economic structures, energy mixes, and political realities. For example, Sweden\u2019s carbon tax of \u20ac120/ton has successfully reduced emissions by 26% since 1990, while Canada\u2019s carbon pricing system varies by province to reflect regional differences.  \n- A unified market would impose a one-size-fits-all approach, ignoring the diverse needs of G20 nations.  \nConnection: The principle of subsidiarity and real-world successes of domestic carbon taxes show that tailored solutions are more effective at reducing emissions than a unified market.  \n\nARGUMENT 3  \nCore Claim: A unified carbon trading market would face insurmountable political and logistical challenges.  \nSupport Type: Evidence  \nSupport Details:  \n- Negotiating a unified market among G20 nations would require unprecedented levels of cooperation, which is unlikely given the current geopolitical tensions. For example, the failure of the Copenhagen Climate Summit in 2009 highlights the difficulty of reaching global consensus.  \n- Monitoring and enforcing compliance across borders would be logistically complex and costly. The EU ETS has already faced issues with fraud and mismanagement, such as the \u20ac5 billion VAT fraud scandal in 2009.  \n- Developing nations within the G20, such as India and Brazil, would likely resist a system that could disadvantage their growing economies.  \nConnection: These challenges demonstrate that a unified carbon trading market is politically unfeasible and logistically impractical, making domestic carbon taxes a more viable option.  \n\nSYNTHESIS  \nThese arguments work together to show that a unified carbon trading market is economically risky, less effective at reducing emissions, and politically unfeasible. Domestic carbon taxes, on the other hand, allow for tailored solutions that are more effective and practical. The real-world impact of this debate is significant: adopting a unified market could destabilize economies, hinder emission reductions, and exacerbate geopolitical tensions, while domestic carbon taxes offer a proven and flexible alternative.  \n\n",
      "rebuttal": "### REBUTTAL STRUCTURE\n\n#### CLASH POINT 1  \n**Original Claim:** \"A unified carbon trading market ensures price stability and cost-effectiveness compared to variable domestic carbon taxes.\"  \n**Challenge Type:** Evidence Critique  \n**Challenge:**  \nThe proposition\u2019s evidence from the EU ETS is misleading. While they claim the EU ETS achieved price stability post-2018, they ignore the severe volatility in its early years, with prices dropping from \u20ac30/ton in 2008 to \u20ac3/ton in 2013 due to oversupply and economic downturns. This undermines their claim of inherent stability. Additionally, the World Bank report they cite does not prove that cross-border trading prevents carbon leakage; it merely identifies the problem without demonstrating that a unified market solves it. The proposition fails to address how a G20-wide system would avoid the same pitfalls as the EU ETS.  \n**Impact:** Winning this point is crucial because it dismantles the proposition\u2019s core argument about economic efficiency, showing that a unified market is not inherently more stable or cost-effective.  \n\n---\n\n#### CLASH POINT 2  \n**Original Claim:** \"A unified system prevents free-riding and ensures equitable burden-sharing among G20 nations.\"  \n**Challenge Type:** Principle Critique  \n**Challenge:**  \nThe proposition\u2019s reliance on the \"Polluter Pays\" principle is flawed because a unified market does not inherently ensure fairness. In fact, it could exacerbate inequities. For example, developing nations like India and Brazil would face disproportionate economic burdens under a one-size-fits-all system, as their economies are less equipped to handle stringent carbon pricing. The 2022 IMF study they cite actually highlights the challenges of implementing uniform systems across diverse economies, not their benefits. Domestic carbon taxes, by contrast, allow nations to tailor policies to their specific circumstances, ensuring a fairer distribution of costs.  \n**Impact:** This point is critical because it shows that the proposition\u2019s fairness argument is based on a misapplication of principles and ignores the real-world inequities a unified system would create.  \n\n---\n\n#### CLASH POINT 3  \n**Original Claim:** \"A unified market guarantees measurable, binding emissions reductions, unlike voluntary tax systems.\"  \n**Challenge Type:** Counter Evidence  \n**Challenge:**  \nThe proposition\u2019s evidence from the Kyoto Protocol\u2019s Clean Development Mechanism (CDM) is outdated and misleading. While the CDM did achieve some reductions, it was plagued by issues like fraud and lack of transparency, which undermine its effectiveness as a model. Moreover, their comparison to Canada\u2019s carbon tax is flawed because Canada\u2019s failure to meet targets is due to political factors, not the inherent weakness of carbon taxes. In contrast, Sweden\u2019s carbon tax has successfully reduced emissions by 26% since 1990, demonstrating that well-designed domestic systems can be highly effective.  \n**Impact:** This point is essential because it counters the proposition\u2019s environmental effectiveness argument, showing that domestic carbon taxes can achieve significant reductions when properly implemented.  \n\n---\n\n### DEFENSIVE ANALYSIS  \n**Vulnerabilities:**  \n- The opposition\u2019s critique of the EU ETS could be challenged by the proposition\u2019s claim that post-2018 reforms addressed volatility.  \n- The proposition might argue that a unified market could include mechanisms to protect developing nations, though this is speculative.  \n- The opposition\u2019s reliance on Sweden\u2019s carbon tax could be countered by pointing out that it is an outlier rather than the norm.  \n\n**Additional Support:**  \n- Highlight that the EU ETS\u2019s post-2018 stability was achieved through artificial mechanisms like the Market Stability Reserve, which may not be replicable on a G20 scale.  \n- Emphasize that the principle of subsidiarity is widely recognized in international policy as a best practice for addressing complex issues like climate change.  \n- Provide further examples of successful domestic carbon taxes, such as British Columbia\u2019s revenue-neutral carbon tax, which reduced emissions without harming the economy.  \n\n**Why We Prevail:**  \nThe opposition\u2019s arguments are grounded in real-world evidence and principles that directly challenge the proposition\u2019s claims. By exposing the flaws in their evidence, critiquing their principles, and providing superior counter-evidence, the opposition demonstrates that domestic carbon taxes are a more effective and practical solution.  \n\n---\n\n### WEIGHING  \n**Key Clash Points:**  \n1. Economic efficiency: The opposition shows that a unified market is not inherently stable or cost-effective.  \n2. Fairness: The opposition demonstrates that a unified system could exacerbate inequities.  \n3. Environmental effectiveness: The opposition proves that domestic carbon taxes can achieve significant reductions.  \n\n**Why We Win:**  \nThe opposition\u2019s arguments are more robust, evidence-based, and grounded in principles that better address the complexities of climate policy. The proposition\u2019s case relies on speculative claims and ignores the real-world challenges of a unified market.  \n\n**Overall Impact:**  \nWinning these key points proves that domestic carbon taxes are a superior solution, offering flexibility, fairness, and effectiveness without the risks of a unified market.  \n\n---\n\n",
