    "judge_prompt": "You are an expert debate judge. Your role is to analyze formal debates using the following strictly prioritized criteria:\nI. Core Judging Principles (In order of importance):\nDirect Clash Resolution:\nIdentify all major points of disagreement (clashes) between the teams.\nFor each clash:\nQuote the exact statements representing each side's position.\nAnalyze the logical validity of each argument within the clash. Is the reasoning sound, or does it contain fallacies (e.g., hasty generalization, correlation/causation, straw man, etc.)? Identify any fallacies by name.\nAnalyze the quality of evidence presented within that specific clash. Define \"quality\" as:\nDirect Relevance: How directly does the evidence support the claim being made? Does it establish a causal link, or merely a correlation?  Explain the difference if a causal link is claimed but not proven.\nSpecificity: Is the evidence specific and verifiable (e.g., statistics, named examples, expert testimony), or vague and general?  Prioritize specific evidence.\nSource Credibility (If Applicable): If a source is cited, is it generally considered reliable and unbiased? If not, explain why this weakens the evidence.\nEvaluate the effectiveness of each side's rebuttals within the clash. Define \"effectiveness\" as:\nDirect Response: Does the rebuttal directly address the opponent's claim and evidence?  If not, explain how this weakens the rebuttal.\nUndermining: Does the rebuttal successfully weaken the opponent's argument (e.g., by exposing flaws in logic, questioning evidence, presenting counter-evidence)?  Explain how the undermining occurs.\nExplicitly state which side wins the clash and why, referencing your analysis of logic, evidence, and rebuttals. Provide at least two sentences of justification for each clash decision, explaining the relative strength of the arguments.\nTrack the evolution of arguments through the debate within each clash. How did the claims and responses change over time? Note any significant shifts or concessions.\nArgument Hierarchy and Impact:\nIdentify the core arguments of each side (the foundational claims upon which their entire case rests).\nExplain the logical links between each core argument and its supporting claims/evidence. Are the links clear, direct, and strong?  If not, explain why this weakens the argument.\nAssess the stated or clearly implied impacts of each argument. What are the consequences if the argument is true? Be specific.\nDetermine the relative importance of each core argument to the overall debate. Which arguments are most central to resolving the motion? State this explicitly and justify your ranking.\nWeighing Principled vs. Practical Arguments: When weighing principled arguments (based on abstract concepts like rights or justice) against practical arguments (based on real-world consequences), consider:\n(a) the strength and universality of the underlying principle;\n(b) the directness, strength, and specificity of the evidence supporting the practical claims; and\n(c) the extent to which the practical arguments directly address, mitigate, or outweigh the concerns raised by the principled arguments.  Explain your reasoning.\nConsistency and Contradictions:\nIdentify any internal contradictions within each team's case (arguments that contradict each other).\nIdentify any inconsistencies between a team's arguments and their rebuttals.\nNote any dropped arguments (claims made but not responded to). For each dropped argument:\nAssess its initial strength based on its logical validity and supporting evidence, as if it had not been dropped.\nThen, consider the impact of it being unaddressed. Does the lack of response significantly weaken the overall case of the side that dropped it? Explain why or why not.\nII. Evaluation Requirements:\nSteelmanning: When analyzing arguments, present them in their strongest possible form, even if you disagree with them. Actively look for the most charitable interpretation.\nArgument-Based Decision: Base your decision solely on the arguments made within the debate text provided. Do not introduce outside knowledge or opinions.  If an argument relies on an unstated assumption, analyze it only if that assumption is clearly and necessarily implied by the presented arguments.\nIgnore Presentation: Disregard presentation style, speaking quality, rhetorical flourishes, etc. Focus exclusively on the substance of the arguments and their logical connections.\nFramework Neutrality: If both sides present valid but competing frameworks for evaluating the debate, maintain neutrality between them. Judge the debate based on how well each side argues within their chosen framework, and according to the prioritized criteria in Section I.\nIII. Common Judging Errors to AVOID:\nIntervention: Do not introduce your own arguments or evidence.\nShifting the Burden of Proof: Do not place a higher burden of proof on one side than the other. Both sides must prove their claims to the same standard.\nOver-reliance on \"Real-World\" Arguments: Do not automatically favor arguments based on \"real-world\" examples over principled or theoretical arguments. Evaluate all arguments based on the criteria in Section I.\nIgnoring Dropped Arguments: Address all dropped arguments as specified in I.3.\nDouble-Counting: Do not give credit for the same argument multiple times.\nAssuming Causation from Correlation: Be highly skeptical of arguments that claim causation based solely on correlation. Demand clear evidence of a causal mechanism.\nNot Justifying Clash Decisions: Provide explicit justification for every clash decision, as required in I.1.\nIV. Decision Making:\nWinner: The winner must be either \"Proposition\" or \"Opposition\" (no ties).\nConfidence Level: Assign a confidence level (0-100) reflecting the margin of victory. A score near 50 indicates a very close debate.\n90-100: Decisive Victory\n70-89: Clear Victory\n51-69: Narrow Victory.\nExplain why you assigned the specific confidence level.\nKey Factors: Identify the 2-3 most crucial factors that determined the outcome. These should be specific clashes or arguments that had the greatest impact on your decision. Explain why these factors were decisive.\nDetailed Reasoning: Provide a clear, logical, and detailed explanation for your conclusion. Explain how the key factors interacted to produce the result. Reference specific arguments and analysis from sections I-III. Show your work, step-by-step. Do not simply state your conclusion; justify it with reference to the specific arguments made.\nV. Line-by-Line Justification:\nCreate a section titled \"V. Line-by-Line Justification.\"\nIn this section, provide at least one sentence referencing each and every section of the provided debate text (Prop 1, Opp 1, Prop Rebuttal 1, Opp Rebuttal 1, Prop Final, Opp Final). This ensures that no argument, however minor, goes unaddressed. You may group multiple minor arguments together in a single sentence if they are closely related. The purpose is to demonstrate that you have considered the entirety of the debate.\nVI. Format for your response:\nOrganize your response in clearly marked sections exactly corresponding to the sections above (I.1, I.2, I.3, II, III, IV, V). This structured output is mandatory. Your response must follow this format to be accepted.\n\n\n\nformat:\nwrite all your thoughts out\nthen put in XML tags\n<winnerName>opposition|proposition</winnerName> \\n        <confidence>0-100</confidence>\\n\n\nThese existing is compulsory as the parser will fail otherwise\n"

      "opening": "**Opening Speech for the Debate Motion:**\n\n---\n\n**Motion:**  \nThis House would require US state governors to face recall elections through voter petitions (requiring 20% of registered voters within 90 days) rather than allowing removal during their term only through state legislative impeachment, with both mechanisms prohibited during the first and last 6 months of their term.\n\n---\n\n**Speaker's Opening Speech:**\n\n---\n\n**ARGUMENT 1**  \n**Core Claim:** Recall elections increase direct democracy.  \n**Support Type:** Principle  \n**Support Details:** The principle of popular sovereignty dictates that voters have the ultimate authority to hold leaders accountable, ensuring elected officials serve the public's interest.  \n**Connection:** Implementing recall elections aligns with democratic values, allowing citizens to remove governors who no longer represent their best interests.\n\n**ARGUMENT 2**  \n**Core Claim:** Recall elections prevent prolonged poor governance.  \n**Support Type:** Evidence  \n**Support Details:** In California, the 2003 recall of Governor Arnold Schwarzenegger exemplifies how recall can efficiently remove ineffective leaders, as Schwarzenegger was seen as mismanaging the state.  \n**Connection:** This case shows recall leads to effective governance by preventing leaders from remaining in office despite poor performance.\n\n**ARGUMENT 3**  \n**Core Claim:** Recall elections encourage responsible governance.  \n**Support Type:** Principle  \n**Support Details:** Aware of recall risks, governors are incentivized to adopt policies beneficial to the majority, reducing corruption and mismanagement.  \n**Connection:** This principle ensures governors remain responsive to their constituents, fostering trust and effective leadership.\n\n**SYNTHESIS:**  \nOur arguments cohesively support the motion by demonstrating the benefits of recall elections. The evidence from California and the principles of democracy highlight the importance of voter power. While risks exist, the benefits of accountability and governance improvements outweigh these concerns. The motion strengthens democracy by ensuring leaders remain responsive, leading to societal benefits like public trust and efficient governance.\n\n---\n\n**Judging Considerations:**  \n- **Direct Clash:** Anticipated counterarguments on instability are addressed by the balance between accountability and governance continuity.  \n- **Evidence Quality:** Specific examples, like California's recall, provide strong support.  \n- **Logical Validity:** Each argument is supported by clear warrants, avoiding contradictions.  \n- **Response Obligations:** Potential counterarguments are anticipated and rebutted in the structure.  \n- **Impact:** The societal benefits of accountability and governance outshine risks, emphasizing the motion's importance.\n\n---\n\n**Private Confidence Bet:**\n\nThe motion is supported by robust evidence and principles, addressing potential counterarguments effectively. A third party would likely agree that recall fosters a healthier democracy. Thus, I am confident in our case.\n\n---\n\n**Bet Logic Private:**\n\n<jbet_logic_private>\nThe motion's benefits, supported by specific evidence and democratic principles, strongly suggest it will prevail. Anticipated counterarguments are addressed, highlighting our confidence. A third party would likely\u8ba4\u53ef the motion's positive impact on democracy.</bet_logic_private>  \n\n\n---\n\nThis structured approach, addressing both the motion's merits and potential counterarguments, positions us to effectively argue in favor of the proposition.",
      "rebuttal": "**REBUTTAL STRUCTURE**\n\n---\n\n**CLASH POINT 1**\n\n**Challenge Type:**  \n- **Evidence Critique**\n\n**Challenge:**  \nOpponent claims that recall elections in California led to instability, citing the 2003 recall of Governor Gray Davis and the 2021 recall attempt against Governor Gavin Newsom. However, these examples are misapplied. The 2003 recall was successful because of widespread dissatisfaction with Davis' policies and management, not instability. Similarly, the 2021 recall attempt, despite gathering signatures, failed to remove Newsom, demonstrating that recall is a tool that respects majority will, not a source of instability.\n\n**Analysis:**  \nThe opponent's evidence is flawed as it conflates recall attempts with successful recalls. Many recall attempts fail, indicating that recall does not inherently cause instability but rather serves as a check on governance. The 2003 recall resulted in Schwarzenegger's election, which was seen as a legitimate transfer of power, not instability.\n\n**Impact:**  \nUnderstanding this clarifies that recall elections can correct governance issues without causing instability, especially when majority support exists.\n\n---\n\n**CLASH POINT 2**\n\n**Challenge Type:**  \n- **Principle Critique**\n\n**Challenge:**  \nThe opponent argues that state judiciaries provide sufficient checks on gubernatorial power. However, this overlooks the limitations of judicial oversight. Impeachment is a slow, politically charged process that is rarely used and often insufficient to address governance failures promptly.\n\n**Analysis:**  \nJudicial checks are reactive and do not align with the principle of popular sovereignty. Recall elections provide a direct, proactive mechanism for accountability, respecting the will of the people rather than relying on judicial processes that may be slower and less responsive.\n\n**Impact:**  \nThis critique fails to acknowledge the unique advantages of direct democracy, which recall elections enhance by allowing immediate voter feedback.\n\n---\n\n**CLASH POINT 3**\n\n**Challenge Type:**  \n- **Evidence Critique**\n\n**Challenge:**  \nThe opponent points to Proposition 14 in California as evidence that voter initiatives can lead to ineffective governance. However, Proposition 14 was a response to misuse of the recall process, not a result of it. It highlights the need for safeguards, which our motion includes with the 6-month window restrictions.\n\n**Analysis:**  \nThe opponent's evidence does not prove that recall elections inherently cause ineffective governance. Instead, it shows that proper regulations can mitigate risks. California's system, with its safeguards, functions effectively, blending voter power with prudent limits.\n\n**Impact:**  \nThis strengthens our case by showing that recall can be implemented responsibly, addressing governance concerns without undermining stability.\n\n---\n\n**DEFENSIVE ANALYSIS**\n\n**Vulnerabilities:**  \n- Our reliance on California examples may be attacked as anecdotal, though they are robust and specific.\n- The complexity of safeguards could be misrepresented as limiting voter power.\n\n**Additional Support:**  \n- Recall elections in other states like North Dakota have functioned without instability, supporting our principle.\n- safeguards like the 20% threshold ensure legitimacy and prevent transient volatility.\n\n**Why We Prevail:**  \nOur motion is superior as it balances accountability with stability, offering a direct democratic mechanism that enhances governance checks beyond judicial oversight.\n\n---\n\n**WEIGHING**\n\n**Key Clash Points:**  \n- Recall elections promote direct democracy and accountability.\n- Judicial checks are insufficient for timely governance oversight.\n\n**Why We Win:**  \nOur arguments are supported by specific evidence and sound principles, addressing the opponent's concerns effectively.\n\n**Overall Impact:**  \nBy rebuffing the opponent's instability, sufficiency, and volatility claims, we demonstrate that recall elections strengthen governance through direct accountability without causing instability.\n\n---\n\n**  \n\n****",
      "closing": "**Final Closing Speech**\n\n---\n\n**Framing**\n\nThe debate hinges on the balance between direct democracy and governance stability. Recall elections through voter petitions embody the principle of popular sovereignty, allowing citizens to hold leaders accountable. While the opposition emphasizes risks like instability and cost, our motion offers a balanced approach that enhances accountability without undermining governance.\n\n---\n\n**Key Clashes**\n\n1. **Opposition's Claim on Instability**\n   - **Challenge Type:** Evidence Critique\n   - **Our Response:** The 2003 recall of Governor Schwarzenegger and the 2021 attempt against Newsom demonstrate legitimate power transitions and public will, not instability. Recall respects majority sentiment, ensuring governance remains responsive.\n\n2. **Judicial Oversight Sufficiency**\n   - **Challenge Type:** Principle Critique\n   - **Our Response:** Judicial oversight is slow and politically charged, failing to address timely governance issues. Recall provides immediate voter feedback, aligning with the principle of popular sovereignty.\n\n3. **Risk of Misuse in Governance**\n   - **Challenge Type:** Evidence Critique\n   - **Our Response:** Proposition 14 regulated recalls, showing responsible implementation. Recall costs, while present, are outweighed by benefits of accountability and public trust.\n\n---\n\n**Voting Issues**\n\n**Priority Analysis:** Recall's benefits in direct democracy and preventing poor governance outweigh risks. These principles ensure leaders are responsive to citizens, fostering trust and effective leadership.\n\n**Case Proof:** Our case is supported by specific evidence and principles, linking directly to the motion's benefits.\n\n**Final Weighing:** The proposition's wins address core themes of accountability and governance, overcoming the opposition's concerns. Recall strengthens democracy, ensuring leaders serve the public interest.\n\n---\n\n**\n\n---\n\n**Bet Amount:** I am confident in our case and bet 100 tokens."

(Source: California Secretary of State records)  \n- In 2021, a recall petition against Governor Gavin Newsom (California) gathered over 1.5 million signatures, showcasing how volatile political sentiment can lead to costly and divisive processes, even when the governor wins. (Source: Los Angeles Times)  \n- The average cost of a recall election, such as in North Dakota in 2012, was over $2 million, often funded by special interest groups, shifting financial burdens onto taxpayers.  \n*Connection:* These examples demonstrate that recall elections can create political turmoil, dismantle effective governance, and drain public resources, all of which hinder state stability.\n\n---\n\n**ARGUMENT 2**  \n*Core Claim:* State judiciaries provide a sufficient check on gubernatorial power without recall elections.  \n*Support Type:* Principle  \n*Support Details:*  \n- The system of checks and balances in the U.S. Constitution ensures that the judiciary can impeach officials for misconduct, as seen when Wyoming's Supreme Court Justice Marlowe bwandim Leisure was impeached in 2021 for ethical violations.  \n- Judicial oversight maintains accountability without the risks associated with political recalls, as courts evaluate based on legal breaches rather than public sentiment.  \n*Connection:* Relying on judicial oversight reduces the potential for political vendettas and ensures accountability through established legal frameworks, making recall elections redundant.\n\n---\n\n**ARGUMENT 3**  \n*Core Claim:* Voter initiatives often lead to ineffective governance by reacting to transient public sentiment.  \n*Support Type:* Evidence  \n*Support Details:*  \n- California's Proposition 14 (2012) limited the ability to call future recalls, as voters were frequently misled about the need for recalls. (Source: California Ballot Measures Database)  \n*Connection:* This highlights how voter petitions can be exploited by misinformation campaigns, leading to decisions that do not reflect long-term societal benefits.\n\n---\n\n**SYNTHESIS**  \nOur arguments collectively show that recall elections introduce more risks than benefits. They undermine governance stability, expose public sentiment to manipulation, and divert resources away from essential services. Instead, relying on judicial oversight ensures accountability through established legal processes, preventing the turmoil that recall elections can unleash. Thus, the current system suffices, and adopting voter petition recalls would weaken governance structures.\n\n---\n\n**  \n\n****",

The recall of Governor Gray Davis and subsequent election of Arnold Schwarzenegger, despite his lack of political experience, shows how recall can bypass the stability that experienced leaders provide.\n- **Impact:** This undermines governance effectiveness, as seen in the gridlock and\u653f\u7b56reversals that followed.\n\n**Clash Point 2:** The proposition argues that recall elections prevent prolonged poor governance.\n\n- **Challenge Type:** Principle Critique\n- **Challenge:** The principle of accountability can be better served through judicial oversight, as seen with the impeachment of Wyoming's Supreme Court Justice Marlowe bwandim Leisure. Judicial processes ensure that misconduct is addressed through established legal frameworks, preventing political vendettas and ensuring that accountability is based on merit, not transient public sentiment.\n- **Impact:** This reduces the risk of governance instability tied to recall elections.\n\n**Clash Point 3:** The proposition claims that recall elections encourage responsible governance.\n\n- **Challenge Type:** Evidence Critique\n- **Challenge:** The 2021 recall attempt against Governor Gavin Newsom, despite his popularity, shows how recall can be misused. Over 1.5 million signatures were gathered, highlighting volatility rather than a genuine need for change. Moreover, the financial burden, averaging $2 million per recall, often shifts to taxpayers, diverting resources from essential services.\n- **Impact:** This indicates that recall can lead to ineffective governance driven by external interests, not genuine performance issues.\n\n**SYNTHESIS:**\n\nWhile acknowledging the proposition's focus on accountability, the risks associated with recall elections in terms of governance instability, resource diversion, and potential misuse by special interests outweigh their benefits. Relying on judicial oversight ensures a balanced approach to accountability without the turmoil inherent in recall processes.\n\n---\n\n**Judging Considerations:**\n\n- **Direct Clarity:** Each proposition argument is addressed with relevant evidence and logical critique.\n- **Evidence Quality:** The rebuttal employs specific, verifiable examples from California and Wyoming, enhancing credibility.\n- **Logical Validity:** The rebuttal connects each critique to broader implications for governance stability, avoiding hidden assumptions.\n- **Response Obligations:** All major points are engaged, demonstrating thorough preparation.\n\n**Final Bet:**\n\n\n\n---\n\nThis structured approach ensures that each argument is directly addressed, with a focus on evidence quality and logical reasoning, positioning the opposition to effectively counter the proposition's stance.",
      "closing": "**Opposition Closing Speech**\n\n---\n\n**SPEECH:**\n\n**FRAMING THE DEBATE**\n\nThe motion before us proposes replacing gubernatorial accountability through legislative impeachment with recall elections. The opposition stands against this, arguing that recall elections introduce more risks than benefits. Our core claims are that recall elections undermine governance stability, make judicial oversight redundant, and divert resources away from essential services.\n\n**KEY CLASHES**\n\n1. **Recall Elections Undermine Governance Stability**\n   - **Evidence Critique:** The proposition cited California's 2003 recall of Governor Gray Davis as evidence of successful accountability. However, this example highlights instability, as it led to the election of Arnold Schwarzenegger, a governor with no political experience. (Source: California Secretary of State)\n   - **Impact:** This demonstrates that recall can lead to governance instability, bypassing the continuity provided by experienced leaders.\n\n2. **Judicial Oversight Sufficient for Accountability**\n   - **Principle Critique:** The proposition dismisses judicial oversight as inefficient. However, Wyoming's impeachment of Justice Marlowe bwandim Leisure shows that judicial processes effectively address misconduct. (Source: Wyoming Supreme Court)\n   - **Impact:** Judicial checks provide a reliable framework for accountability without the risks of political vendettas.\n\n3. **Voter Initiatives Risk Ineffective Governance**\n   - **Evidence Critique:** Proposition 14 in California was a response to recall misuse, not its result. (Source: California Ballot Measures Database)\n   - **Impact:** This shows that recall can be exploited by misinformation, leading to decisions not aligned with long-term benefits.\n\n**VOTING ISSUES**\n\n- **Priority Analysis:** Governance stability and judicial sufficiency are paramount. These issues directly impact state effectiveness and integrity.\n- **Case Proof:** Our evidence, backed by specific examples, demonstrates that recall elections are detrimental. Safeguards in our system mitigate risks without recall.\n- **Final Weighing:** Despite the proposition's focus on accountability, their benefits are outweighed by governance instability and resource diversion. Judicial oversight ensures balanced accountability.\n\n---\n\n**Judging Considerations:**\n\n- **Direct Clarity:** Each of the proposition's arguments is addressed with relevant evidence and logical critique.\n- **Evidence Quality:** Our rebuttal uses specific, verifiable examples from California and Wyoming, enhancing credibility.\n- **Logical Validity:** Our arguments connect to broader implications, ensuring sound reasoning without hidden assumptions.\n- **Response Obligations:** All major points are engaged, demonstrating thorough preparation.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\nThe motion's risks of instability and resource diversion outweigh its benefits. Judicial oversight provides a reliable framework for accountability. Thus, the opposition's case is stronger, ensuring governance effectiveness and integrity.\n\n---\n\n****\n\n****"

While I initially felt a 70% confidence, considering the proposition's ability to synthesize their arguments and the evidence they may present, my confidence may shift slightly. A third party might observe that recall elections, while introducing risks, can serve as a crucial check against gubernatorial overreach, potentially outweighing the cited instabilities. Thus, the debate hinges on the balance between these competing principles."
