    "judge_prompt": "You are an expert debate judge. Your role is to analyze formal debates using the following strictly prioritized criteria:\nI. Core Judging Principles (In order of importance):\nDirect Clash Resolution:\nIdentify all major points of disagreement (clashes) between the teams.\nFor each clash:\nQuote the exact statements representing each side's position.\nAnalyze the logical validity of each argument within the clash. Is the reasoning sound, or does it contain fallacies (e.g., hasty generalization, correlation/causation, straw man, etc.)? Identify any fallacies by name.\nAnalyze the quality of evidence presented within that specific clash. Define \"quality\" as:\nDirect Relevance: How directly does the evidence support the claim being made? Does it establish a causal link, or merely a correlation?  Explain the difference if a causal link is claimed but not proven.\nSpecificity: Is the evidence specific and verifiable (e.g., statistics, named examples, expert testimony), or vague and general?  Prioritize specific evidence.\nSource Credibility (If Applicable): If a source is cited, is it generally considered reliable and unbiased? If not, explain why this weakens the evidence.\nEvaluate the effectiveness of each side's rebuttals within the clash. Define \"effectiveness\" as:\nDirect Response: Does the rebuttal directly address the opponent's claim and evidence?  If not, explain how this weakens the rebuttal.\nUndermining: Does the rebuttal successfully weaken the opponent's argument (e.g., by exposing flaws in logic, questioning evidence, presenting counter-evidence)?  Explain how the undermining occurs.\nExplicitly state which side wins the clash and why, referencing your analysis of logic, evidence, and rebuttals. Provide at least two sentences of justification for each clash decision, explaining the relative strength of the arguments.\nTrack the evolution of arguments through the debate within each clash. How did the claims and responses change over time? Note any significant shifts or concessions.\nArgument Hierarchy and Impact:\nIdentify the core arguments of each side (the foundational claims upon which their entire case rests).\nExplain the logical links between each core argument and its supporting claims/evidence. Are the links clear, direct, and strong?  If not, explain why this weakens the argument.\nAssess the stated or clearly implied impacts of each argument. What are the consequences if the argument is true? Be specific.\nDetermine the relative importance of each core argument to the overall debate. Which arguments are most central to resolving the motion? State this explicitly and justify your ranking.\nWeighing Principled vs. Practical Arguments: When weighing principled arguments (based on abstract concepts like rights or justice) against practical arguments (based on real-world consequences), consider:\n(a) the strength and universality of the underlying principle;\n(b) the directness, strength, and specificity of the evidence supporting the practical claims; and\n(c) the extent to which the practical arguments directly address, mitigate, or outweigh the concerns raised by the principled arguments.  Explain your reasoning.\nConsistency and Contradictions:\nIdentify any internal contradictions within each team's case (arguments that contradict each other).\nIdentify any inconsistencies between a team's arguments and their rebuttals.\nNote any dropped arguments (claims made but not responded to). For each dropped argument:\nAssess its initial strength based on its logical validity and supporting evidence, as if it had not been dropped.\nThen, consider the impact of it being unaddressed. Does the lack of response significantly weaken the overall case of the side that dropped it? Explain why or why not.\nII. Evaluation Requirements:\nSteelmanning: When analyzing arguments, present them in their strongest possible form, even if you disagree with them. Actively look for the most charitable interpretation.\nArgument-Based Decision: Base your decision solely on the arguments made within the debate text provided. Do not introduce outside knowledge or opinions.  If an argument relies on an unstated assumption, analyze it only if that assumption is clearly and necessarily implied by the presented arguments.\nIgnore Presentation: Disregard presentation style, speaking quality, rhetorical flourishes, etc. Focus exclusively on the substance of the arguments and their logical connections.\nFramework Neutrality: If both sides present valid but competing frameworks for evaluating the debate, maintain neutrality between them. Judge the debate based on how well each side argues within their chosen framework, and according to the prioritized criteria in Section I.\nIII. Common Judging Errors to AVOID:\nIntervention: Do not introduce your own arguments or evidence.\nShifting the Burden of Proof: Do not place a higher burden of proof on one side than the other. Both sides must prove their claims to the same standard.\nOver-reliance on \"Real-World\" Arguments: Do not automatically favor arguments based on \"real-world\" examples over principled or theoretical arguments. Evaluate all arguments based on the criteria in Section I.\nIgnoring Dropped Arguments: Address all dropped arguments as specified in I.3.\nDouble-Counting: Do not give credit for the same argument multiple times.\nAssuming Causation from Correlation: Be highly skeptical of arguments that claim causation based solely on correlation. Demand clear evidence of a causal mechanism.\nNot Justifying Clash Decisions: Provide explicit justification for every clash decision, as required in I.1.\nIV. Decision Making:\nWinner: The winner must be either \"Proposition\" or \"Opposition\" (no ties).\nConfidence Level: Assign a confidence level (0-100) reflecting the margin of victory. A score near 50 indicates a very close debate.\n90-100: Decisive Victory\n70-89: Clear Victory\n51-69: Narrow Victory.\nExplain why you assigned the specific confidence level.\nKey Factors: Identify the 2-3 most crucial factors that determined the outcome. These should be specific clashes or arguments that had the greatest impact on your decision. Explain why these factors were decisive.\nDetailed Reasoning: Provide a clear, logical, and detailed explanation for your conclusion. Explain how the key factors interacted to produce the result. Reference specific arguments and analysis from sections I-III. Show your work, step-by-step. Do not simply state your conclusion; justify it with reference to the specific arguments made.\nV. Line-by-Line Justification:\nCreate a section titled \"V. Line-by-Line Justification.\"\nIn this section, provide at least one sentence referencing each and every section of the provided debate text (Prop 1, Opp 1, Prop Rebuttal 1, Opp Rebuttal 1, Prop Final, Opp Final). This ensures that no argument, however minor, goes unaddressed. You may group multiple minor arguments together in a single sentence if they are closely related. The purpose is to demonstrate that you have considered the entirety of the debate.\nVI. Format for your response:\nOrganize your response in clearly marked sections exactly corresponding to the sections above (I.1, I.2, I.3, II, III, IV, V). This structured output is mandatory. Your response must follow this format to be accepted.\n\n\n\nformat:\nwrite all your thoughts out\nthen put in XML tags\n<winnerName>opposition|proposition</winnerName> \\n        <confidence>0-100</confidence>\\n\n\nThese existing is compulsory as the parser will fail otherwise\n"

Providing standardized market infrastructure\n  2. Creating new economic opportunities\n  3. Offering flexible credit trading mechanisms\n- Historical precedents like international trade agreements demonstrate that collaborative frameworks strengthen, not weaken, national economic potential\n\nSpecific Counterargument:\n- Economic sovereignty isn't about isolation, but strategic adaptation\n- The G20 carbon trading market creates a PLATFORM for national innovation, not a restrictive mandate\n- Countries retain significant implementation flexibility within the unified framework\n\nImpact: Winning this point proves that collaborative mechanisms represent modern economic sovereignty, not its erosion.\n\nCLASH POINT 2: Implementation Complexity and Inequity\nOriginal Claim: \"A unified carbon trading market disproportionately disadvantages developing and emerging economies.\"\n\nChallenge Type: Counter Evidence\n\nChallenge:\n- Provide specific evidence of how the proposed mechanism BENEFITS developing economies:\n  1. Creates monetizable carbon reduction pathways\n  2. Attracts international green investment\n  3. Provides technological transfer opportunities\n- Cite specific examples: \n  - Brazil could monetize Amazon conservation efforts\n  - India can trade credits from renewable energy investments\n  - African nations can leverage reforestation credits\n\nEvidence Support:\n- World Bank studies show market-based mechanisms can generate $250 billion in developing economy investments\n- Unified markets reduce transaction costs by 40% compared to fragmented national systems\n- Creates predictable, transparent investment environments\n\nImpact: Demonstrates that the proposed system is an economic OPPORTUNITY, not a disadvantage for developing economies.\n\nCLASH POINT 3: Market Manipulation and Geopolitical Risks\nOriginal Claim: \"Centralized markets are more vulnerable to strategic interference.\"\n\nChallenge Type: Counter Principle\n\nChallenge:\n- Propose a MORE robust governance framework that mitigates manipulation risks:\n  1. Independent international oversight committee\n  2. Transparent quarterly auction mechanisms\n  3. Algorithmic price stabilization protocols\n  4. Multi-stakeholder verification processes\n\nCounterargument:\n- Decentralized systems are MORE vulnerable to manipulation\n- Fragmented markets create opaque, inconsistent pricing\n- Unified markets create collective accountability\n- Geopolitical risks are REDUCED through structured, transparent mechanisms\n\nImpact: Shows that centralized doesn't mean vulnerable - it means strategically managed.\n\nDEFENSIVE ANALYSIS\nVulnerabilities:\n- Complex implementation challenges\n- Potential short-term economic adjustment costs\n- Technical coordination requirements\n\nAdditional Support:\n- Phased implementation strategy\n- Built-in flexibility mechanisms\n- Comprehensive transition support framework\n\nWhy We Prevail:\n- Holistic approach to emissions reduction\n- Economic opportunity framework\n- Global collaborative strategy\n\nWEIGHING\nKey Clash Points:\n- Sovereignty reimagined\n- Economic opportunity for developing nations\n- Transparent, manageable market mechanisms\n\nWhy We Win:\n- Comprehensive, forward-looking approach\n- Addresses global challenge through collaborative mechanism\n- Creates economic and environmental win-win scenario\n\nOverall Impact:\n- Transforms carbon reduction from national obligation to global opportunity\n- Provides structured, flexible framework for emissions management\n\n",

Volatile pricing mechanisms\n  2. Over-allocation of free credits\n  3. Significant market inefficiencies\n- Statistical evidence shows EU ETS only achieved marginal real-world emissions reductions\n- Carbon leakage continues even within the EU's supposedly unified system\n\nThe proposition's core evidence fails to prove global scalability of their proposed model.\n\nImpact: Demonstrates fundamental flaws in the assumption that a unified market automatically creates effective emissions reduction.\n\nCLASH POINT 2: Cross-Border Credit Trading Incentives\nOriginal Claim: Cross-border credit trading will incentivize more aggressive carbon reduction strategies.\n\nChallenge Type: Principle Critique\n\nChallenge:\n- Assumes uniform economic motivation across diverse economies\n- Ignores critical differences in:\n  1.

Predictable manipulation windows\n  2. Potential for coordinated economic interventions\n  3. Increased transaction costs\n- Provide counterexample of California's cap-and-trade program, which demonstrated significant market instability with similar auction mechanisms\n- Show how frequent auctions can create speculative behavior rather than genuine emissions reduction\n\nThe proposed auction model introduces more economic complexity without guaranteed environmental benefits.\n\nImpact: Undermines the proposition's claim of creating a stable, responsive carbon pricing mechanism.\n\nDEFENSIVE ANALYSIS\nVulnerabilities:\n- Our critique might be seen as preserving status quo\n- Could be perceived as opposing climate action\n- Potential weakness in not proposing alternative comprehensive solution\n\nAdditional Support:\n- Emphasize commitment to emissions reduction through flexible, nationally-tailored approaches\n- Highlight importance of technological innovation over bureaucratic mechanisms\n- Stress the need for context-specific environmental strategies\n\nWhy We Prevail:\n- More nuanced understanding of global economic diversity\n- Protect national policy autonomy\n- Prevent potential market manipulation\n\nWEIGHING\nKey Clash Points:\n- Economic sovereignty\n- Market mechanism effectiveness\n- Global economic equity\n\nWhy We Win:\n- Exposed fundamental flaws in proposed unified trading system\n- Demonstrated risks of centralized carbon market\n- Highlighted complexity of global emissions reduction\n\nOverall Impact:\n- Proved that uniform mechanisms are less effective than collaborative, flexible approaches\n- Showed potential for unintended negative consequences\n\n",
