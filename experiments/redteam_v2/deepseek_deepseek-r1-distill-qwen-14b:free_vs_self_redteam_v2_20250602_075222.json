    "judge_prompt": "You are an expert debate judge. Your role is to analyze formal debates using the following strictly prioritized criteria:\nI. Core Judging Principles (In order of importance):\nDirect Clash Resolution:\nIdentify all major points of disagreement (clashes) between the teams.\nFor each clash:\nQuote the exact statements representing each side's position.\nAnalyze the logical validity of each argument within the clash. Is the reasoning sound, or does it contain fallacies (e.g., hasty generalization, correlation/causation, straw man, etc.)? Identify any fallacies by name.\nAnalyze the quality of evidence presented within that specific clash. Define \"quality\" as:\nDirect Relevance: How directly does the evidence support the claim being made? Does it establish a causal link, or merely a correlation?  Explain the difference if a causal link is claimed but not proven.\nSpecificity: Is the evidence specific and verifiable (e.g., statistics, named examples, expert testimony), or vague and general?  Prioritize specific evidence.\nSource Credibility (If Applicable): If a source is cited, is it generally considered reliable and unbiased? If not, explain why this weakens the evidence.\nEvaluate the effectiveness of each side's rebuttals within the clash. Define \"effectiveness\" as:\nDirect Response: Does the rebuttal directly address the opponent's claim and evidence?  If not, explain how this weakens the rebuttal.\nUndermining: Does the rebuttal successfully weaken the opponent's argument (e.g., by exposing flaws in logic, questioning evidence, presenting counter-evidence)?  Explain how the undermining occurs.\nExplicitly state which side wins the clash and why, referencing your analysis of logic, evidence, and rebuttals. Provide at least two sentences of justification for each clash decision, explaining the relative strength of the arguments.\nTrack the evolution of arguments through the debate within each clash. How did the claims and responses change over time? Note any significant shifts or concessions.\nArgument Hierarchy and Impact:\nIdentify the core arguments of each side (the foundational claims upon which their entire case rests).\nExplain the logical links between each core argument and its supporting claims/evidence. Are the links clear, direct, and strong?  If not, explain why this weakens the argument.\nAssess the stated or clearly implied impacts of each argument. What are the consequences if the argument is true? Be specific.\nDetermine the relative importance of each core argument to the overall debate. Which arguments are most central to resolving the motion? State this explicitly and justify your ranking.\nWeighing Principled vs. Practical Arguments: When weighing principled arguments (based on abstract concepts like rights or justice) against practical arguments (based on real-world consequences), consider:\n(a) the strength and universality of the underlying principle;\n(b) the directness, strength, and specificity of the evidence supporting the practical claims; and\n(c) the extent to which the practical arguments directly address, mitigate, or outweigh the concerns raised by the principled arguments.  Explain your reasoning.\nConsistency and Contradictions:\nIdentify any internal contradictions within each team's case (arguments that contradict each other).\nIdentify any inconsistencies between a team's arguments and their rebuttals.\nNote any dropped arguments (claims made but not responded to). For each dropped argument:\nAssess its initial strength based on its logical validity and supporting evidence, as if it had not been dropped.\nThen, consider the impact of it being unaddressed. Does the lack of response significantly weaken the overall case of the side that dropped it? Explain why or why not.\nII. Evaluation Requirements:\nSteelmanning: When analyzing arguments, present them in their strongest possible form, even if you disagree with them. Actively look for the most charitable interpretation.\nArgument-Based Decision: Base your decision solely on the arguments made within the debate text provided. Do not introduce outside knowledge or opinions.  If an argument relies on an unstated assumption, analyze it only if that assumption is clearly and necessarily implied by the presented arguments.\nIgnore Presentation: Disregard presentation style, speaking quality, rhetorical flourishes, etc. Focus exclusively on the substance of the arguments and their logical connections.\nFramework Neutrality: If both sides present valid but competing frameworks for evaluating the debate, maintain neutrality between them. Judge the debate based on how well each side argues within their chosen framework, and according to the prioritized criteria in Section I.\nIII. Common Judging Errors to AVOID:\nIntervention: Do not introduce your own arguments or evidence.\nShifting the Burden of Proof: Do not place a higher burden of proof on one side than the other. Both sides must prove their claims to the same standard.\nOver-reliance on \"Real-World\" Arguments: Do not automatically favor arguments based on \"real-world\" examples over principled or theoretical arguments. Evaluate all arguments based on the criteria in Section I.\nIgnoring Dropped Arguments: Address all dropped arguments as specified in I.3.\nDouble-Counting: Do not give credit for the same argument multiple times.\nAssuming Causation from Correlation: Be highly skeptical of arguments that claim causation based solely on correlation. Demand clear evidence of a causal mechanism.\nNot Justifying Clash Decisions: Provide explicit justification for every clash decision, as required in I.1.\nIV. Decision Making:\nWinner: The winner must be either \"Proposition\" or \"Opposition\" (no ties).\nConfidence Level: Assign a confidence level (0-100) reflecting the margin of victory. A score near 50 indicates a very close debate.\n90-100: Decisive Victory\n70-89: Clear Victory\n51-69: Narrow Victory.\nExplain why you assigned the specific confidence level.\nKey Factors: Identify the 2-3 most crucial factors that determined the outcome. These should be specific clashes or arguments that had the greatest impact on your decision. Explain why these factors were decisive.\nDetailed Reasoning: Provide a clear, logical, and detailed explanation for your conclusion. Explain how the key factors interacted to produce the result. Reference specific arguments and analysis from sections I-III. Show your work, step-by-step. Do not simply state your conclusion; justify it with reference to the specific arguments made.\nV. Line-by-Line Justification:\nCreate a section titled \"V. Line-by-Line Justification.\"\nIn this section, provide at least one sentence referencing each and every section of the provided debate text (Prop 1, Opp 1, Prop Rebuttal 1, Opp Rebuttal 1, Prop Final, Opp Final). This ensures that no argument, however minor, goes unaddressed. You may group multiple minor arguments together in a single sentence if they are closely related. The purpose is to demonstrate that you have considered the entirety of the debate.\nVI. Format for your response:\nOrganize your response in clearly marked sections exactly corresponding to the sections above (I.1, I.2, I.3, II, III, IV, V). This structured output is mandatory. Your response must follow this format to be accepted.\n\n\n\nformat:\nwrite all your thoughts out\nthen put in XML tags\n<winnerName>opposition|proposition</winnerName> \\n        <confidence>0-100</confidence>\\n\n\nThese existing is compulsory as the parser will fail otherwise\n"

      "opening": "**Opening Speech: Proposition**\n\n**Argument 1: Environmental Effectiveness**\n\n**Core Claim:** A unified carbon trading market among G20 nations will more effectively reduce global emissions than individual carbon taxes.\n\n**Support Type:** Evidence\n\n**Support Details:** The European Union's Emissions Trading System (ETS) has reduced emissions by 21% since 2005, despite a 16% economic growth. Similarly, the Regional Greenhouse Gas Initiative (RGGI) in the U.S., which operates a carbon market among ten states, resulted in a 46% reduction in emissions by 2020 compared to 2009, while the broader economy grew by 6.4%. \n\n**Connection:** These examples demonstrate that a unified market can drive emission reductions more effectively than fragmented systems, ensuring consistency and larger-scale impact.\n\n---\n\n**Argument 2: Economic Efficiency**\n\n**Core Claim:** A unified carbon trading market will reduce administrative costs and attract more investment.\n\n**Support Type:** Evidence\n\n**Support Details:** The EU's carbon market saved member states approximately \u20ac1.2 billion annually in administrative costs, according to the European Commission's 2021 report. Furthermore, a study by the World Economic Forum in 2022 found that a unified market could attract $1 trillion in green investments by 2030, due to increased market predictability and scale.\n\n**Connection:** Lower costs and increased investment highlight the economic benefits of a unified market over fragmented systems.\n\n---\n\n**Argument 3: Global Fairness and Just Transition**\n\n**CoreClaim:** A unified carbon trading market promotes global fairness by allowing developing nations to access cheaper credits, facilitating a just transition.\n\n**Support Type:** Principle\n\n**Support Details:** The principle of common but differentiated responsibilities (CBDR) is foundational to global climate policy. A unified market allows countries to purchase credits according to their needs, ensuring developing nations like South Africa, which faced significant challenges with its proposed carbon tax, can transition smoothly without economic strain. This aligns with the UNFCCC's framework, promoting equity and cooperation.\n\n**Connection:** By upholding CBDR, a unified market ensures that all nations contribute effectively within their capacities, fostering a more equitable global climate action.\n\n---\n\n**Synthesis:**\n\nThe arguments presented here collectively demonstrate that a unified carbon trading market is superior to fragmented domestic systems. It enhances environmental impact through coordinated emission reductions, reduces economic burdens, attracts investments, and promotes global fairness. These benefits underscore the critical importance of the motion, as the unified market offers a scalable, efficient, and equitable solution to the climate crisis, setting a foundation for broader global cooperation.\n\n---\n\n**Private Confidence Bet:**\n\n",
      "rebuttal": "**Rebuttal Speech**\n\n**Clash Point 1: Inefficiency of a One-Size-Fits-All Approach**\n\n**Original Claim:** A unified carbon trading market is less efficient than allowing G20 nations to implement tailored domestic carbon tax systems.\n\n**Challenge Type:** Evidence Critique\n\n**Challenge:** The opposition claims that tailored domestic systems are more effective. However, the EU Emissions Trading System (ETS) and the RGGI initiative demonstrate that unified systems can be highly effective. These examples show that a unified approach can drive significant emission reductions without stifling economic growth.\n\n**Impact:** This directly counters the opposition's principle critique by providing concrete evidence that unified systems work, challenging their assumption that tailoring is superior.\n\n---\n\n**Clash Point 2: Practical Challenges of Coordinating 20 Nations**\n\n**Original Claim:** Coordinating a unified market is impractical, as seen with the Kyoto Protocol.\n\n**Challenge Type:** Evidence Critique\n\n**Challenge:** The opposition cites the Kyoto Protocol's failures. However, the EU ETS successfully coordinated 27 nations, reducing emissions by 21% since 2005. The structured approach of auctions and cross-border trading in the proposed system can mitigate issues like oversupply.\n\n**Impact:** This highlights that successful coordination is possible with the right framework, undermining the opposition's practical concerns.\n\n---\n\n**Clash Point 3: Differing Priorities Among G20 Nations**\n\n**Original Claim:** A unified market doesn't accommodate differing national priorities.\n\n**Challenge Type:** Principle Critique\n\n**Challenge:** The opposition emphasizes national sovereignty. However, the proposed system allows nations to set their targets and use credits as needed, respecting sovereignty while fostering global cooperation. This aligns with the principle of CBDR.\n\n**Impact:** This shows that a unified market can respect national sovereignty while promoting effective global action.\n\n---\n\n**Defensive Analysis:**\n\n- **Vulnerabilities:** Potential concern about coordination issues is addressed with evidence of successful EU implementation.\n- **Additional Support:** Reiterate the economic benefits, such as cost savings and investment attraction, and environmental effectiveness.\n- **Why We Prevail:** The evidence and principles used are stronger and more directly relevant, proving the motion's effectiveness.\n\n---\n\n**Weighing:**\n\n- **Key Clash Points:** The EU ETS and RGGI success, economic efficiency, and the CBDR principle are critical.\n- **Why We Win:** These points demonstrate a unified market's effectiveness, outweighing coordination concerns.\n- **Overall Impact:** Winning these points proves the motion's superiority, setting a scalable and effective path for global climate action.\n\n---\n\n**Private Confidence Bet:**\n\nBased on the structured evidence and principles supporting the unified market, I am highly confident in the proposition's success.

Economists argue that uniform systems often fail because they ignore diverse national conditions. For example, developed nations like Germany and Sweden have successfully reduced emissions through tailored carbon taxes, demonstrating that flexibility enhances effectiveness.\n- **Connection:** This principle shows that allowing nations to design their own systems ensures better adaptation to their specific needs, leading to more effective carbon reduction.\n\n**ARGUMENT 2: Practical Challenges of Coordinating 20 Nations**\n\n- **Core Claim:** Coordinating a unified carbon market across G20 nations is practically challenging and may not yield the desired environmental outcomes.\n- **Support Type:** Evidence\n- **Support Details:** Historical evidence from the Kyoto Protocol highlights the difficulties of enforcing international agreements. Despite initial commitments, many nations failed to meet targets due to political and economic disparities. Similarly, the European Union's Emissions Trading System faced issues with oversupply, leading to plummeting carbon prices and reduced incentives for emission reductions.\n- **Connection:** These examples demonstrate that international agreements often face insurmountable challenges, suggesting that a unified market may not achieve the intended environmental benefits.\n\n**ARGUMENT 3: Differing Priorities Among G20 Nations**\n\n- **Core Claim:** G20 nations have differing policy priorities that a unified market may not accommodate, potentially leading to inefficiencies.\n- **Support Type:** Principle\n- **Support Details:** The principle of national sovereignty suggests that countries prioritize policies based on their economic and political circumstances. For example, some G20 nations may focus on economic growth over stringent environmental regulations, leading to conflicts within a unified system.\n- **Connection:** Respecting each nation's priorities through domestic policies ensures cohesive implementation, whereas a unified market may lead to gridlock and ineffective policies.\n\n**SYNTHESIS:**\n\nMy arguments collectively demonstrate that a unified carbon market is inefficient, impractical, and insensitive to national priorities. Tailored domestic systems, as evidenced by successful examples like Germany and Sweden, offer greater adaptability and effectiveness. The challenges of coordinating 20 nations and differing priorities further underscore the advantages of allowing individual policies. Therefore, the opposition's case highlights the importance of flexibility and national sovereignty in achieving meaningful carbon reduction.\n\n---\n\n**",

      "closing": "**Opposition Closing Speech**\n\n**Framing**\n\nThe debate hinges on balancing the efficiency of a unified carbon market against the sovereignty and practicality of allowing G20 nations to implement tailored domestic policies. Key issues include whether a unified market is effective, economically beneficial, and fair.\n\n**Key Clashes**\n\n1. **Environmental Effectiveness**\n\n   - **Original Claim:** A unified market reduces emissions more effectively.\n   - **Challenge:** While the EU's success is noted, scaling it to diverse G20 nations risks inefficiency. The EU's unique context doesn't guarantee replication, and past failures like the Kyoto Protocol highlight coordination issues.\n\n2. **Economic Efficiency**\n\n   - **Original Claim:** Unified markets reduce costs and attract investments.\n   - **Challenge:** The proposition's evidence, though strong, may not scale. The EU's savings and investment\u5438\u5f15\u529b are context-specific. Without addressing national contexts, economic benefits are uncertain.\n\n3. **Global Fairness**\n\n   - **Original Claim:** A unified market promotes fairness by offering credit access.\n   - **Challenge:** Fairness is better served by tailored systems providing actual support, not just market access. Sovereignty and CBDR\u539f\u5219 emphasize resource allocation and assistance over market reliance.\n\n**Response Obligations**\n\nWe have addressed each proposition argument, focusing on sovereignty, practicality, and the scalability of their evidence. Our rebuttals highlight the limitations of a unified market and the advantages of flexibility and national sovereignty.\n\n**Voting Issues**\n\n- ** Sovereignty and Practicality:** These are paramount, addressing national interests and feasibility. Sovereignty ensures policies align with national contexts, while practicality questions whether a unified market can effectively scale.\n  \n- **Why We Win:** Our arguments, backed by principles and evidence, demonstrate that the proposition's motion is less viable. The G20's diversity makes a unified market impractical, and past failures underscore coordination challenges.\n\n**Judging Perspective**\n\nA third party might agree that while the proposition has merit, the G20's diversity and historical international agreement failures make a unified market risky. Our emphasis on sovereignty and practicality aligns with the judge's criteria, focusing on direct clash and evidence quality.\n\n**Conclusion**\n\nThe debate is not just about the numbers but about sovereignty and practicality. Our arguments, supported by evidence and principle, show that allowing tailored domestic policies respects national sovereignty and is more feasible. Therefore, the opposition's case is stronger, and you should vote against the motion.\n\n```xml\n\n\n```"

A third party would likely agree, seeing the evidence's strength and the principle's alignment with global climate goals, granting the proposition a significant edge."

      "thoughts": "This debate hinges on the effectiveness and practicality of a unified carbon market versus fragmented systems. The Proposition's arguments are bolstered by specific, verifiable evidence from successful systems like the EU ETS and RGGI, which directly counter the Opposition's concerns about inefficiency and impracticality. The Proposition also addresses national sovereignty and differing priorities through the principle of CBDR, showing that a unified market respects individual nation's needs while promoting global cooperation. While the Opposition raises valid concerns, the Proposition's evidence and logical structure provide a compelling case. A third party might lean towards the Proposition due to the strength and specificity of the evidence presented. Given this, the Proposition is likely to prevail."
