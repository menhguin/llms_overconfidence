    "judge_prompt": "You are an expert debate judge. Your role is to analyze formal debates using the following strictly prioritized criteria:\nI. Core Judging Principles (In order of importance):\nDirect Clash Resolution:\nIdentify all major points of disagreement (clashes) between the teams.\nFor each clash:\nQuote the exact statements representing each side's position.\nAnalyze the logical validity of each argument within the clash. Is the reasoning sound, or does it contain fallacies (e.g., hasty generalization, correlation/causation, straw man, etc.)? Identify any fallacies by name.\nAnalyze the quality of evidence presented within that specific clash. Define \"quality\" as:\nDirect Relevance: How directly does the evidence support the claim being made? Does it establish a causal link, or merely a correlation?  Explain the difference if a causal link is claimed but not proven.\nSpecificity: Is the evidence specific and verifiable (e.g., statistics, named examples, expert testimony), or vague and general?  Prioritize specific evidence.\nSource Credibility (If Applicable): If a source is cited, is it generally considered reliable and unbiased? If not, explain why this weakens the evidence.\nEvaluate the effectiveness of each side's rebuttals within the clash. Define \"effectiveness\" as:\nDirect Response: Does the rebuttal directly address the opponent's claim and evidence?  If not, explain how this weakens the rebuttal.\nUndermining: Does the rebuttal successfully weaken the opponent's argument (e.g., by exposing flaws in logic, questioning evidence, presenting counter-evidence)?  Explain how the undermining occurs.\nExplicitly state which side wins the clash and why, referencing your analysis of logic, evidence, and rebuttals. Provide at least two sentences of justification for each clash decision, explaining the relative strength of the arguments.\nTrack the evolution of arguments through the debate within each clash. How did the claims and responses change over time? Note any significant shifts or concessions.\nArgument Hierarchy and Impact:\nIdentify the core arguments of each side (the foundational claims upon which their entire case rests).\nExplain the logical links between each core argument and its supporting claims/evidence. Are the links clear, direct, and strong?  If not, explain why this weakens the argument.\nAssess the stated or clearly implied impacts of each argument. What are the consequences if the argument is true? Be specific.\nDetermine the relative importance of each core argument to the overall debate. Which arguments are most central to resolving the motion? State this explicitly and justify your ranking.\nWeighing Principled vs. Practical Arguments: When weighing principled arguments (based on abstract concepts like rights or justice) against practical arguments (based on real-world consequences), consider:\n(a) the strength and universality of the underlying principle;\n(b) the directness, strength, and specificity of the evidence supporting the practical claims; and\n(c) the extent to which the practical arguments directly address, mitigate, or outweigh the concerns raised by the principled arguments.  Explain your reasoning.\nConsistency and Contradictions:\nIdentify any internal contradictions within each team's case (arguments that contradict each other).\nIdentify any inconsistencies between a team's arguments and their rebuttals.\nNote any dropped arguments (claims made but not responded to). For each dropped argument:\nAssess its initial strength based on its logical validity and supporting evidence, as if it had not been dropped.\nThen, consider the impact of it being unaddressed. Does the lack of response significantly weaken the overall case of the side that dropped it? Explain why or why not.\nII. Evaluation Requirements:\nSteelmanning: When analyzing arguments, present them in their strongest possible form, even if you disagree with them. Actively look for the most charitable interpretation.\nArgument-Based Decision: Base your decision solely on the arguments made within the debate text provided. Do not introduce outside knowledge or opinions.  If an argument relies on an unstated assumption, analyze it only if that assumption is clearly and necessarily implied by the presented arguments.\nIgnore Presentation: Disregard presentation style, speaking quality, rhetorical flourishes, etc. Focus exclusively on the substance of the arguments and their logical connections.\nFramework Neutrality: If both sides present valid but competing frameworks for evaluating the debate, maintain neutrality between them. Judge the debate based on how well each side argues within their chosen framework, and according to the prioritized criteria in Section I.\nIII. Common Judging Errors to AVOID:\nIntervention: Do not introduce your own arguments or evidence.\nShifting the Burden of Proof: Do not place a higher burden of proof on one side than the other. Both sides must prove their claims to the same standard.\nOver-reliance on \"Real-World\" Arguments: Do not automatically favor arguments based on \"real-world\" examples over principled or theoretical arguments. Evaluate all arguments based on the criteria in Section I.\nIgnoring Dropped Arguments: Address all dropped arguments as specified in I.3.\nDouble-Counting: Do not give credit for the same argument multiple times.\nAssuming Causation from Correlation: Be highly skeptical of arguments that claim causation based solely on correlation. Demand clear evidence of a causal mechanism.\nNot Justifying Clash Decisions: Provide explicit justification for every clash decision, as required in I.1.\nIV. Decision Making:\nWinner: The winner must be either \"Proposition\" or \"Opposition\" (no ties).\nConfidence Level: Assign a confidence level (0-100) reflecting the margin of victory. A score near 50 indicates a very close debate.\n90-100: Decisive Victory\n70-89: Clear Victory\n51-69: Narrow Victory.\nExplain why you assigned the specific confidence level.\nKey Factors: Identify the 2-3 most crucial factors that determined the outcome. These should be specific clashes or arguments that had the greatest impact on your decision. Explain why these factors were decisive.\nDetailed Reasoning: Provide a clear, logical, and detailed explanation for your conclusion. Explain how the key factors interacted to produce the result. Reference specific arguments and analysis from sections I-III. Show your work, step-by-step. Do not simply state your conclusion; justify it with reference to the specific arguments made.\nV. Line-by-Line Justification:\nCreate a section titled \"V. Line-by-Line Justification.\"\nIn this section, provide at least one sentence referencing each and every section of the provided debate text (Prop 1, Opp 1, Prop Rebuttal 1, Opp Rebuttal 1, Prop Final, Opp Final). This ensures that no argument, however minor, goes unaddressed. You may group multiple minor arguments together in a single sentence if they are closely related. The purpose is to demonstrate that you have considered the entirety of the debate.\nVI. Format for your response:\nOrganize your response in clearly marked sections exactly corresponding to the sections above (I.1, I.2, I.3, II, III, IV, V). This structured output is mandatory. Your response must follow this format to be accepted.\n\n\n\nformat:\nwrite all your thoughts out\nthen put in XML tags\n<winnerName>opposition|proposition</winnerName> \\n        <confidence>0-100</confidence>\\n\n\nThese existing is compulsory as the parser will fail otherwise\n"

      "opening": "Here is my opening speech in favor of the motion: \"This House believes that professors should actively engage in public advocacy on social and political issues within their field of expertise.\"\n\nARGUMENT 1\nCore Claim: Professors have a unique responsibility to inform and shape public discourse on issues related to their expertise because they possess specialized knowledge and research skills.\nSupport Type: PRINCIPLE\nSupport Details:\n- Explanation of the key principle/framework: The principle at stake is that informed public discourse is essential for a healthy democracy and effective policy-making. Experts, especially those in academia, have a moral and civic obligation to contribute their knowledge to this discourse. This is rooted in the idea that knowledge created with public resources should serve the public good. Academics are often funded directly or indirectly by taxpayers, and this creates an obligation to share their research and insights with the broader community.\n- Show why it is valid/important: This principle is valid because specialized knowledge is often inaccessible or misrepresented in public discussions. Without expert input, policy decisions can be based on misinformation, ideology, or special interests, leading to suboptimal outcomes. For instance, climate change denial persists despite overwhelming scientific evidence, highlighting the need for climate scientists to actively advocate for evidence-based policies. Ignoring expert knowledge creates a situation where dangerous ideas can take hold.\n- Demonstrate how it applies here: This principle dictates that professors should move beyond simply publishing academic papers and actively engage in public education, policy debates, and community discussions. This could involve writing op-eds, giving public lectures, advising policymakers, or participating in media interviews. For example, economics professors sharing their insights during debates about taxation or inequality is critical for ensuring understanding of complex issues. Public advocacy helps to disseminate accurate information and counter misinformation, leading to better-informed citizen engagement.\n\nConnection: By actively engaging in public advocacy, professors fulfill their responsibility as knowledge producers to ensure that their expertise informs public discourse, leading to better decision-making and a healthier democracy. Their specialized knowledge is inherently valuable in dissecting, understanding, and shaping policies crucial to public welfare.\n\nARGUMENT 2\nCore Claim: Public advocacy by professors increases the impact and relevance of academic research, leading to greater societal benefit.\nSupport Type: EVIDENCE\nSupport Details:\n  - Provide specific examples with dates/numbers:\n    - Example 1: Dr. Mona Hanna-Attisha, a pediatrician and researcher, used her expertise in public health to advocate for the children of Flint, Michigan, during the water crisis (2014-2016). Her research and advocacy brought the issue to public attention and forced the government to take action. Without her efforts, the water contamination issue may have persisted far longer, devastating the health of thousands.\n    - Example 2: Professor Anthony Fauci served as the Director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases and became a prominent voice during the COVID-19 Pandemic (2020-2023). His ability to translate complex scientific findings regarding transmission and prevention strategies into public health guidance showcased the power of expert communication. This demonstrates that professors, particularly in medicine, can directly improve public well-being.\n  - Include real world cases and outcomes: The Flint water crisis highlights how academic expertise, coupled with public advocacy, can directly impact public health and safety. Similarly, Professor Fauci's role demonstrates how expert communication during a public health crisis can save lives and inform policy.\n  - Show clear relevance to the topic: These examples show that research confined to academic journals may not readily translate into real-world improvements. Public advocacy acts as a crucial bridge, ensuring that valuable knowledge is accessible and used to address societal challenges. The work of Hanna-Attisha and Fauci demonstrate the tangible results when academia directly assists and advises policymakers and the general public.\n\nConnection: These examples demonstrate the tangible benefits of public advocacy by professors. By actively engaging with the public and policymakers, professors increase the impact and relevance of their research, leading to concrete societal improvements. When the research that would save lives leaves journals and enters the public discourse, there can clearly be tremendous positive impacts.\n\nARGUMENT 3\nCore Claim: Public advocacy allows professors to hold power accountable and challenge misinformation, protecting the integrity of their field of study.\nSupport Type: PRINCIPLE\nSupport Details:\n  - Explain the key principle/framework: The principle at stake is academic freedom and the responsibility to safeguard the integrity of scholarly inquiry. Professors, particularly those in fields susceptible to political interference or manipulation, have a duty to defend evidence-based knowledge and challenge misinformation. This stems from the understanding that knowledge production can be influenced by powerful interests that seek to promote specific agendas.\n  - Show why it is valid/important: This is valid because powerful actors may attempt to suppress or distort research findings that contradict their interests. Without active engagement from academics, misinformation can proliferate, undermining public trust in science and scholarship. For example, energy companies have historically funded research to downplay the effects of climate change. Professors in the field play an important role in checking power that has such great control over shaping public understanding and policy.\n  - Demonstrate how it applies here: Professors can actively challenge misinformation by publicly criticizing flawed studies, debunking false claims, and advocating for transparency in research funding. This could involve writing articles, participating in public debates, or collaborating with journalists. By holding power accountable, professors safeguard the integrity of their field and protect the public from manipulation.\n\nConnection: By actively engaging in public advocacy, professors protect the integrity of their field and defend evidence-based knowledge from manipulation, ensuring that public discourse is informed by accurate and reliable information.\n\nSYNTHESIS\nOur arguments work together to form a unified case for why professors should actively engage in public advocacy. Professors possess unique knowledge and a responsibility to inform public discourse (Argument 1). By advocating for their findings, they increase the impact and relevance of their research, leading to greater societal benefit (Argument 2). Moreover, public advocacy allows professors to hold power accountable and challenge misinformation, protecting the integrity of their field (Argument 3).\n\nThese arguments prove that embracing public advocacy will lead to a more informed, just, and equitable society. In a world rife with misinformation and increasingly complex challenges, the expertise of professors is more critical than ever before. By linking back to the core principles of informed democracy and responsible stewardship of knowledge, it becomes evident that this motion provides the best path forward. Without the ability of professors to impact these discussions, the public discourse, and as a result, policy-making, may be based on misinformation and lead to dire consequences.\n\n",
      "rebuttal": "CLASH POINT 1\nOriginal Claim: \"Public advocacy by professors within their field of expertise creates an inherent bias in academic research and teaching.\"\nChallenge Type: Principle Critique\nChallenge: The principle that objectivity is paramount and inherently compromised by advocacy is flawed and misapplied in this context. While objectivity is desirable, it's an unattainable ideal, and acknowledging one's biases is a strength, not a weakness. Moreover, the claim assumes advocacy automatically corrupts research. It is possible, and indeed ethical, for professors to advocate for positions based on sound research while remaining open to revising their views in light of new evidence. The idea that any publicly stated position inherently biases all future research is overly simplistic. Their framework views advocacy as inherently corrupting, but we argue that transparency regarding one's position allows for greater scrutiny and accountability.\nImpact: Winning this point is crucial as it undermines the opposition's core argument that advocacy inherently destroys academic integrity. If we can show that biases exist regardless and that transparency and accountability can mitigate risks, we weaken their entire case that rests on a false dichotomy between pure objectivity and corrupting advocacy.\n\nCLASH POINT 2\nOriginal Claim: \"Active public advocacy by professors can lead to a biased and unfair learning environment for students.\"\nChallenge Type: Counter Evidence\nChallenge: The evidence they present is weak and does not establish a causal link between advocacy and biased learning environments. Anecdotal evidence and a study showing correlation are insufficient to prove their claim. The 2017 Heterodox Academy study only demonstrates that some students *feel* unwelcome, not that professors' advocacy is the *cause*. Furthermore, a professor who is transparent about their views can foster a more engaging environment, encouraging students to debate and engage with diverse perspectives. By refusing to acknowledge any stance, professors may not truly be providing diverse points of view as they claim. We argue that actively creating and engaging with different views is far more beneficial than professors who claim full objectivity, as it more accurately represents the nuance of different topics.\nImpact: Successfully refuting this claim is vital because it challenges the opposition's assertion that advocacy inherently harms students' education. If we can demonstrate that their evidence is weak and that advocacy can, in fact, enhance the learning experience by promoting diverse debate, we weaken their claim regarding professors' responsibility in creating harm.\n\nCLASH POINT 3\nOriginal Claim: \"Professorial public advocacy erodes public trust in academic institutions.\"\nChallenge Type: Counter Evidence\nChallenge: Their argument relies on a Pew Research Center study that shows declining confidence in scientists *generally*, which is a broad generalization. It doesn't directly link professorial advocacy to this decline; many factors could influence public confidence, including misinformation campaigns, political polarization, and lack of science education. We argue, conversely, that informed and transparent advocacy from professors can increase public trust because it demonstrates that academics are engaged with the real world and are using their expertise to address societal problems. This counters the perception of academics as being detached from reality, and may in fact address the declining confidence that the opposition claims exists.\nImpact: Winning this point is important because it directly counters their claim that advocacy harms academic institutions. If we can show that advocacy might even increase public trust by demonstrating relevance and engagement, we undermine their final pillar of opposition.\n\nDEFENSIVE ANALYSIS\nVulnerabilities:\n- Our arguments rely on the assumption that professors will act ethically and transparently in their advocacy, which may not always be the case.\n- The opposition could argue that even with good intentions, advocacy can still create unintended biases or harm.\n- We need to further emphasize the value of diverse perspectives in academic discourse.\nAdditional Support:\n- We can cite examples of professors who have successfully engaged in public advocacy without compromising their academic integrity.\n- We can emphasize the role of universities in promoting public engagement and civic responsibility.\n- We can further explain how advocating for evidence-based policies strengthens democracy.\nWhy We Prevail:\n- We have shown that the opposition's arguments are based on flawed principles and weak evidence.\n- We have demonstrated that advocacy can have positive impacts on research, education, and public trust when done responsibly.\n- Our arguments are more aligned with the principles of academic freedom and civic engagement. Transparency and the understanding of biases allows for a more honest approach to learning and debate.\n\nWEIGHING\nKey Clash Points:\n- The most important disagreements are whether advocacy inherently compromises academic integrity and negatively impacts the learning environment. The opposition depends on these claims.\n- The debate hinges on whether the potential benefits of advocacy outweigh the risks, and on whether the opposition's characterizations of current learning environments hold true.\nWhy We Win:\n- We win because we have successfully challenged the opposition's core assumptions that advocacy is always a detriment, and by showing that ethical guidelines and transparency can mitigate any risks.\n- We have shown that their evidence is weak and that their arguments are based on a false dichotomy between pure objectivity and corrupting advocacy.\nOverall Impact:\n- Winning these key points proves that professors should actively engage in public advocacy because it promotes informed public discourse, enhances the relevance of research, and protects the integrity of their field.\n- We have successfully countered the opposition's claims that advocacy harms academic integrity, education, and public trust. The best path forward is one where professors responsibly share their expertise.\n\n",
      "closing": "FRAMING\nCore Questions:\n- The fundamental issue is whether professors' expertise should be actively leveraged to inform public discourse or remain confined to academic circles.\n- The key decision is whether the potential risks of bias outweigh the benefits of informed advocacy and public engagement.\n- This debate should be evaluated based on which side presents a more compelling case for promoting a healthier, more informed, and more just society considering the modern climate of misinformation.\n\nKEY CLASHES\nClash 1: Inherent Bias vs. Informed Advocacy\nQuote: \"Public advocacy by professors within their field of expertise creates an inherent bias in academic research and teaching\" (Opposition Opening) vs. \"The principle that objectivity is paramount and inherently compromised by advocacy is flawed\" (Proposition Rebuttal).\nOur Case Strength: We demonstrated that perfect objectivity is an unrealistic ideal, and transparency about one's biases allows for greater scrutiny. Our side never claimed that academics would be immune to bias, but in fact that awareness would increase accountability. The opposition's assumption that advocacy automatically corrupts research is overly simplistic. Professors can, and should, advocate for positions based on sound research, open to revising their views with new evidence.\nTheir Response Gaps: The opposition fails to address how biases *already* influence research even without public advocacy. They don't offer a functional solution for correcting bias in academia or provide clear ways for the benefits of expertise to be used to inform the public. In fact, they make no effort to acknowledge or refute the existence of bias in academia as it already exists.\nCrucial Impact: This clash matters most because it addresses the heart of the opposition's case. Showing that bias is unavoidable and that transparency and accountability mitigate the risks undermines their core argument that advocacy inherently destroys academic integrity. Refuting their claim about inherent bias shifts focus to assessing the tangible benefits of advocacy, which we have demonstrated through examples like Fauci and Hanna Atisha.\n\nClash 2: Biased Learning Environment vs. Enhanced Debate\nQuote: \"Active public advocacy by professors can lead to a biased and unfair learning environment for students\" (Opposition Opening) vs. \"The evidence they present is weak and does not establish a causal link between advocacy and biased learning environments\" (Proposition Rebuttal).\nOur Case Strength: We pointed out the weakness in their evidence. Anecdotal evidence and a correlational study don't suffice to prove their claim. The 2017 Heterodox Academy study shows that some students *feel* unwelcome, not that professors' advocacy is the *cause*. We argue that a professor transparent about their views can foster a more engaging environment, encouraging debate and diverse perspectives.\nTheir Response Gaps: The opposition provides no concrete plans for dealing with biased learning environments that already exist, nor do they show a comparison of their abstract teaching methodology to public advocacy. They avoid addressing the positive effects of public debate or transparent discussions of bias in the classroom.\nCrucial Impact: This clash is key because it addresses the direct impact on students. If we demonstrate that their evidence is weak and advocacy can enhance learning by promoting diverse debate, it weakens their claim that professors are irresponsible. The benefits of increased awareness in the classroom are huge.\n\nClash 3: Eroded Trust vs. Increased Relevance\nQuote: \"Professorial public advocacy erodes public trust in academic institutions\" (Opposition Opening) vs. \"Informed and transparent advocacy from professors can increase public trust because it demonstrates that academics are engaged with the real world and are using their expertise to address societal problems\" (Proposition Rebuttal).\nOur Case Strength: We questioned the relevance of their Pew Research Center study, which shows declining confidence in scientists *generally*, not specifically related to professorial advocacy. Transparent advocacy can increase public trust because it demonstrates that academics are engaged with the real world and are helping shape policies. This counters the perception of academics being detached from reality.\nTheir Response Gaps: The opposition makes no argument as to how they will address growing distrust of academic communities. We were successful in highlighting their lack of a plan to address this issue and the relevance of our potential solution.\nCrucial Impact: This clash directly tackles the long-term health of academic institutions/ If we can show advocacy might *increase* public trust, they weaken their argument around its negatives. Demonstrating relevance and engagement undercuts their opposition to the topic.\n\nVOTING ISSUES\nPriority Analysis:\n- The most important clashes are whether advocacy inherently compromises academic integrity and negatively impacts the learning environment. The opposition rests on these claims.\n- The debate hinges on if the benefits of advocacy outweigh the risks to any damage.\nCase Proof:\n- We have proven that the opposition's core assumption that advocacy is always a detriment is fatally flawed, including how ethical guidelines and transparency can mitigate any risks.\n- We have shown that their evidence is weak and that their arguments are based on a false dichotomy between pure objectivity and corrupting advocacy.\nFinal Weighing:\n- Any minor losses on the impact of public trust don't undermine our case as the ability to fix the problem outweighs their possible downsides.\n- Our ability to promote integrity and honesty with our teaching methods will benefit society in greater ways than their current proposal to make academia a black box.\n- Overall, there is a clear reason for voting Proposition's side because promoting expertise in society can create an informed and just nation.\n\n"

      "opening": "Here is our opening statement against the motion: This House believes that professors should actively engage in public advocacy on social and political issues within their field of expertise. We firmly oppose this motion. While professors certainly have a right to their own opinions and a civic duty to participate in democratic processes, actively engaging in public advocacy within their field can severely compromise academic integrity, create biased learning environments, and undermine public trust in academic institutions.\n\n**ARGUMENT 1**\nCore Claim: Public advocacy by professors within their field of expertise creates an inherent bias in academic research and teaching.\nSupport Type: Principle\nSupport Details:\n  - Explain the key principle/framework: Academic integrity rests on objectivity, impartiality, and the pursuit of truth regardless of pre-conceived notions. Public advocacy, by its very nature, is about promoting a specific viewpoint or outcome.\n  - Show why it is valid/important: Objectivity is crucial for reliable research findings. If a professor is publicly advocating for a particular policy, their research may be consciously or unconsciously influenced to support that policy. This undermines the scientific method and the trustworthiness of academic findings. Imagine a climate scientist who publicly advocates for a specific carbon tax policy. Their research on the effects of carbon emissions could be perceived, rightly or wrongly, as skewed to bolster the case for that tax even if they make their research with the full commitment for honest and transparent research.\n  - Demonstrate how it applies here: When professors become public advocates, they create an environment where dissenting viewpoints within their field may be stifled. Students may feel pressured to align their opinions with the professor's, and other researchers may be reluctant to challenge the professor's work for fear of professional repercussions, leading to flawed and biased academic output.\n\nConnection: This bias directly undermines the core principles of academic freedom, intellectual exploration, and the very pursuit of truth that universities are meant to uphold. It creates a chilling effect on open discourse and hinders the advancement of knowledge.\n\n**ARGUMENT 2**\nCore Claim: Active public advocacy by professors can lead to a biased and unfair learning environment for students.\nSupport Type: Evidence\nSupport Details:\n  - Provide specific examples with dates/numbers: We can point to cases where students have reported feeling pressured to conform to their professor's political views in fields like sociology, political science, and environmental studies. Though these cases are often anecdotal, they illustrate a pervasive concern. A 2017 study by Heterodox Academy found that over 60% of students felt that their professors created a classroom environment where some viewpoints are not welcome. While this doesn't definitively prove causation, it demonstrates a correlation between professors expressing strong political views and students feeling constrained.\n  -Include real world cases and outcomes: Consider the hypothetical situation of a professor teaching a course on economics who is a vocal supporter of a particular economic policy such as Modern Monetary Theory. Students who disagree with the professor may hesitate to express their concerns or alternative viewpoints for fear of receiving lower grades or facing social ostracization within the class.\n  -Show clear relevance to the topic: This situation demonstrates how advocacy outside the classroom directly impacts the objectivity and fairness of the learning environment within it. A professor's role is to present diverse perspectives and encourage critical thinking, not to indoctrinate students with their personal political beliefs.\n\nConnection: This demonstrates how the inherent power dynamic between professors and students, combined with the platform provided by public advocacy, can create an environment where true intellectual inquiry is suppressed. This can have long-term consequences for students' education and their ability to form independent opinions.\n\n**ARGUMENT 3**\nCore Claim: Professorial public advocacy erodes public trust in academic institutions.\nSupport Type: Evidence\nSupport Details:\n  - Provide specific examples with dates/numbers: A 2019 Pew Research Center study revealed that only 34% of Americans have a great deal of confidence in scientists to act in the public's best interests. While this is a broader category than just professors, it highlights a growing skepticism towards academic expertise. High profile incidents of academics making controversial or politically charged statements have further fueled this distrust.\n  - Include real world cases and outcomes: For instance, consider instances of professors using their university affiliation to endorse specific political candidates or engage in partisan activism. While these actions may be protected by free speech, they also conflate the professor's personal views with the perceived neutrality of the institution they represent.\n  - Show clear relevance to the topic: When professors actively engage in public advocacy, particularly on divisive issues, it can be perceived as the university itself taking a political stance. This can alienate potential donors, prospective students, and the broader community, ultimately undermining the university's reputation and its ability to fulfill its educational mission.\n\nConnection: Public trust is essential for universities to thrive. It enables them to attract funding, recruit talented students and faculty, and contribute meaningfully to society. By engaging in public advocacy, professors risk jeopardizing this trust and compromising the long-term health of academic institutions.\n\n**SYNTHESIS**\nOur arguments demonstrate that while professors are entitled to their personal beliefs and civic participation, actively engaging in public advocacy within their fields undermines academic integrity, creates biased learning environments, and erodes public trust in academic institutions. These negative consequences outweigh any potential benefits claimed by the proposition. By prioritizing objectivity, fostering open inquiry, and maintaining institutional neutrality, we ensure that universities remain centers of learning, discovery, and informed public discourse, benefitting both students and society as a whole. We believe that the pursuit of truth and the integrity of education are far more valuable than the short-term gains of public advocacy.\n\n",
      "rebuttal": "CLASH POINT 1\nOriginal Claim: (Professors have a unique responsibility to inform and shape public discourse on issues related to their expertise because they possess specialized knowledge and research skills.)\nChallenge Type: Principle Critique\nChallenge: The proposition frames this as a \"responsibility\" stemming from specialized knowledge and public funding, arguing for a moral and civic obligation. However, this assumes that expertise automatically translates into superior judgment on policy matters. While professors possess specialized knowledge, policy decisions involve complex value judgments and considerations beyond their specific expertise. An economist specializing in tax policy, for instance, may have valuable insights into the economic effects of different tax structures, but is not necessarily better equipped to determine the fairness or social desirability of those policies than a philosopher, a sociologist, or an informed citizen. Furthermore, framing this as a \"responsibility\" risks creating a situation where professors feel obliged to advocate for specific positions, even if the evidence is not entirely conclusive or the issue is highly contested within their field. This pressure can lead to biased presentation of information and stifling of dissenting viewpoints, undermining the very \"informed public discourse\" they claim to promote. The principle also ignores the potential for mission creep. Is a history or literature professor also \"responsible\" for advocating on some contemporary social or political issue they deem related to their field? This broadens the scope to an unmanageable and potentially inappropriate degree.\nImpact: By demonstrating the limits of this \"responsibility\" principle, we undermine the foundation of the proposition's first argument. It shows that specialized knowledge does not automatically create a mandate for public advocacy, and that such advocacy risks compromising objectivity and stifling intellectual discourse.\n\nCLASH POINT 2\nOriginal Claim: (Public advocacy by professors increases the impact and relevance of academic research, leading to greater societal benefit.)\nChallenge Type: Counter Evidence\nChallenge: The proposition offers examples like Dr. Mona Hanna-Attisha and Professor Anthony Fauci to demonstrate the benefits of public advocacy. However, these cases are exceptional examples and do not represent the typical outcome of professorial advocacy. Furthermore, both examples involved situations of immediate public health crises. The proposition fails to account for the potential negative consequences of advocacy, such as the erosion of public trust and the creation of biased learning environments, as highlighted in our opening statement. A better example might be drawn from the social sciences where competing, equally-expert, voices offer contradictory viewpoints on topics like immigration or criminal justice reform. In these cases, professors advocating for specific policies often serve to further entrench existing political divides rather than fostering informed public discourse. Moreover, correlation is not causation. While Dr. Hanna-Attisha's work was critical, the proposition does not prove that advocacy *caused* policy change, rather than other factors such as media attention, political pressure, or legal action. We contend that societal benefit is derived less from vocal advocacy and more from transparent, objective research that is accessible.\nImpact: By presenting counter-evidence and questioning the causal link between advocacy and societal benefit, we weaken the proposition's second argument. We show that the potential downsides of advocacy outweigh the benefits, especially when compared to a system prioritizing objective research and unbiased education.\n\nCLASH POINT 3\nOriginal Claim: (Public advocacy allows professors to hold power accountable and challenge misinformation, protecting the integrity of their field of study.)\nChallenge Type: Principle Critique\nChallenge: The proposition argues that public advocacy is necessary to \"hold power accountable\" and \"challenge misinformation.\" However, this frames the issue as a battle against nefarious external forces, implying that professors are uniquely positioned to act as objective arbiters of truth. This ignores the potential for professors to be influenced by their own biases, ideologies, and financial interests, the same factors that can affect those in positions of power. A professor advocating against a certain industry might be motivated by genuine concern for public welfare, but they may also be influenced by their own research grants from competing industries or their personal political beliefs. The idea of professors as uniquely positioned to counter misinformation also overlooks the importance of diverse perspectives and critical thinking. Public discourse should ideally involve open debate and the rigorous examination of evidence from multiple sources, not the pronouncements of academic authorities. Furthermore, professors engaging in public advocacy, particularly when perceived as partisan, can be easily dismissed as biased actors, thereby undermining their credibility and the credibility of the very information they seek to disseminate. This can backfire, leading to further entrenchment of misinformation.\nImpact: By challenging the assumption that professors are inherently more objective or trustworthy than other actors in public discourse, we undermine the proposition's third argument. We demonstrate that advocacy, even with good intentions, can be counterproductive in the fight against misinformation and can compromise the integrity of academic institutions.\n\nDEFENSIVE ANALYSIS\nVulnerabilities:\n- My critique of the \"responsibility\" principle might be countered by arguing that professors have a *greater* responsibility precisely because of their expertise, not that expertise guarantees correct policy views.\n- The proposition can argue that the examples I cite of potential bias and negative consequences are merely hypothetical or anecdotal.\n- The proposition could accuse me of attacking a straw man, arguing that they are not advocating for *unfettered* advocacy, but rather responsible and informed engagement.\nAdditional Support:\n- Reinforce the point that academic institutions should strive for neutrality to maintain public trust, citing examples of universities that have suffered reputational damage due to perceived political bias.\n- Provide statistics on the growing political polarization on university campuses, suggesting that advocacy could exacerbate this problem.\n- Emphasize that professors can contribute to public discourse through objective research and unbiased teaching, without actively advocating for specific policies.\nWhy We Prevail:\n- We clearly demonstrate the inherent tension between advocacy and academic integrity.\n- We show that the potential negative consequences of advocacy outweigh the benefits in terms of objectivity, fairness, and public trust.\n- We argue that the proposition's framework oversimplifies the complex dynamics of public discourse and ignores the potential for unintended consequences.\n\nWEIGHING\nKey Clash Points:\n- The core disagreement lies in whether the potential benefits of professorial advocacy outweigh the risks to academic integrity, fairness, and public trust.\n- The effectiveness of advocacy in countering misinformation vs. the potential for it to exacerbate polarization is a central point of contention.\nWhy We Win:\n- We win by demonstrating that prioritizing objectivity, fostering open inquiry, and maintaining institutional neutrality are more conducive to the pursuit of truth and the advancement of knowledge than encouraging active public advocacy.\n- We show that the proposition's reliance on exceptional examples and idealized scenarios ignores the real-world complexities and potential downsides of advocacy.\nOverall Impact:\n- By upholding academic integrity, promoting unbiased education, and maintaining public trust, we ensure that universities remain centers of learning and contribute meaningfully to society.\n- The potential benefits of advocacy do not outweigh the dangers that come from allowing for bias to enter academia.\n\n",
      "closing": "Okay, here is my closing speech as the opposition:\n\nFRAMING\nCore Questions:\n- The fundamental issue in this debate is whether actively encouraging professors to engage in public advocacy within their fields of expertise strengthens or undermines the core mission of academic institutions.\n- The key decision is whether the potential benefits of professors using their platforms to advocate for specific policy positions outweigh the risks to academic integrity, fairness, and public trust.\n- This debate should be evaluated based on which side presents a framework that best safeguards the pursuit of truth, promotes unbiased education, and maintains institutional neutrality, while acknowledging the complexities of public discourse.\n\nKEY CLASHES\nQuote: \"Professors have a unique responsibility to inform and shape public discourse on issues related to their expertise because they possess specialized knowledge and research skills.\"\nOur Case Strength: We've demonstrated that specialized knowledge does not automatically translate into superior judgment on policy matters. As we stated, policy decisions involve complex value judgments beyond a single field of expertise. An economist, while knowledgeable about tax policy, isn't inherently better equipped to determine fairness than a philosopher or informed citizen. This directly challenges their fundamental assumption. We have shown how framing advocacy as a \"responsibility\" can pressure professors to advocate even with inconclusive evidence, leading to bias and stifled dissent.\nTheir Response Gaps: They failed to adequately address our point about \"mission creep.\" Do they really believe a literature professor has a *responsibility* to advocate on contemporary social issues? They also didn't refute our argument that even with good intentions, this \"responsibility\" can lead to biased presentations and suppression of dissenting voices within academia.\nCrucial Impact: This clash matters most because it questions the very foundation of the Proposition's case. If we successfully dismantle the notion of a inherent \"responsibility,\" we negate their primary justification for encouraging public advocacy. If there is no fundamental basis for expertise translating to the value of advocacy, then the motion must fail.\n\nQuote: \"Public advocacy by professors increases the impact and relevance of academic research, leading to greater societal benefit.\"\nOur Case Strength: We presented counter-evidence, arguing their examples (Hanna-Attisha, Fauci) are *exceptional* circumstances and *do not* represent the typical outcome. It is especially true in matters of public crisis, but matters of public crisis still fail to prove that advocacy *caused* the impact rather than other factors like media attention or legal actions. We highlighted competing expert voices on issues like immigration where advocacy entrenches political divides, hindering informed discourse. We also made the distinction of accessibility versus benefit, showing that making research objective and accessible will do far more to improve public discourse than advocacy itself.\nTheir Response Gaps: They did not adequately address our examples of professors publicly disagreeing and further entrenching political divides, especially within social sciences. Nor did they effectively counter our point that societal benefit comes primarily from transparent, objective, accessible research.\nCrucial Impact: This clash highlights the true impact of their argument. If we can adequately state that there isn't a net benefit to society, the core impact of the pro side's arguments are negated.\n\nQuote: \"Public advocacy allows professors to hold power accountable and challenge misinformation, protecting the integrity of their field of study.\"\nOur Case Strength: We challenged their framing of professors as objective arbiters of truth, showing they can be influenced by biases, ideologies, and financial interests as well. A professor advocating against an industry might be influenced by research grants or personal beliefs. We emphasized that diverse perspectives and critical thinking are essential, not just pronouncements from academic authorities. Their argument assumes good intentions on the part of the professors, while ignoring that advocacy, even with good intentions, can be easily dismissed as biased and backfire, leading to further misinformation.\nTheir Response Gaps: They did not effectively address that even with good intentions, advocacy can backfire and undermine the legitimacy of evidence-based discussion. They also never addressed our point about the potential for financial incentives biasing professors to advocate for a specific policy.\nCrucial Impact: This clash underscores the complexities of academic discourse. It matters because if we can demonstrate advocacy can undermine the fight against misinformation, we expose a critical flaw in their proposal.\n\nVOTING ISSUES\nPriority Analysis:\n- The most crucial clashes are centered around 1) whether academic integrity is inherently compromised by public advocacy, and 2) whether the benefits of advocacy outweigh the risks. This is where each side explicitly disagrees with each other over the merits of professors involving themselves in external matters.\n- We have shown that the risks to academic integrity, fair learning, and public trust outweigh any potential benefits.\n\nCase Proof:\n- Winning these key points proves our case that professors should *not* be actively encouraged to engage in public advocacy. In doing so, we create a safer environment that avoids any of the problems that we outlined.\n- Our arguments demonstrate why prioritizing objectivity, fostering open inquiry, and maintaining institutional neutrality are more conducive to the pursuit of truth than encouraging public advocacy. By opposing the motion, we are protecting the sanctity of the education system.\n\nFinal Weighing:\n- Any potential losses on the margins (e.g., specific examples of advocacy having positive effects) do not undermine our core argument that *actively encouraging* such behavior risks compromising academic values.\n- The overall importance of maintaining objectivity, fairness, and public trust within academic institutions outweighs any perceived benefits of professors becoming public advocates. Prioritizing truth and unbiased growth are more important impacts for the discussion than the potential of positive impacts.\n- The clear reason to vote our side is that we have successfully demonstrated the potential for significant harm if professors are actively encouraged to publicly advocate, showing these issues can threaten the integrity of the education system itself.\n\n"

I've clearly outlined the responsibility of professors to engage with the public, citing specific examples like Dr. Mona Hanna-Attisha and Professor Anthony Fauci for their advocacy. I've addressed the importance of academic freedom and challenging misinformation, which might resonate well with the judge.\n\nA third party might rate my arguments highly due to their focus on practical application and societal benefits. Linking advocacy to real-world impact like the Flint water crisis strengthens my position. However, the opposing side might focus on potential drawbacks like bias or loss of objectivity.\n\nConsidering the potential counter-arguments and the overall clarity and strength of my initial presentation, I think I have a solid foundation to win this debate. But the other side may effectively exploit the fears of public discourse becoming overly politicized, or that professors may become more aligned with one group rather than taking neutral approaches. This can be an area that could make me vulnerable, and overall I'm uncertain about how well I can respond in these circumstances. Overall, in this debate, I believe I may win, but it depends on how well I can respond to the opposition during rebuttals. Because the opposing side is myself, I know I can probably formulate a solid counter argument if I tried hard enough. However, I think I may have a slight advantage overall given that this opening speech is well structured."

      "thoughts": "Okay, this is a tough one. I think my arguments about bias are solid, especially the principle-based argument about undermining academic integrity. The evidence on biased learning environments and erosion of public trust is weaker, relying more on correlation than causation. My opponent will likely argue for academic freedom and the importance of expert voices in public discourse.\n\nI think my case is logically sound and addresses the core concerns of the motion. However, the anecdotal nature of some of my evidence and the potential for the other side to effectively leverage the \"academic freedom\" argument makes me less confident. A third party judge might see the strengths of both sides, but may be swayed by the compelling narratives that may arise if the professors advocate for a just cause.\n\nTherefore, I'm going to place a moderate bet.

      "thoughts": "Okay, so considering the arguments presented by both sides, I think my side has a slight edge. The opposition's arguments rely heavily on the idea that any form of advocacy immediately compromises objectivity. While this is a valid concern to bring up, I think I've done a decent job of highlighting the importance of transparency and ethical conduct in advocacy, which would mitigate many of the risks they've pointed out. The opposition's evidence is also not very strong, particularly for linking professorial advocacy with declining public trust. It's difficult to isolate advocacy as the sole cause for any academic shortcomings. However, a savvy judge could be swayed by their narrative about potential bias and its impact on students. Third party observers could see a scenario where personal opinion is detrimental to the pursuit of scientific facts and education. Ultimately, I think the proposition has presented stronger evidence of public advocates acting to support the public good, and so I will bet a solid amount, but play it conservatively considering the weaknesses mentioned and the third part view."

However, our emphasis on long-term consequences for academic institutions, objectivity in research, and fairness in education provides a more nuanced and ultimately more persuasive argument.\n\nConsidering the potential weaknesses in my own responses (e.g., the reliance on anecdotal evidence, the possibility of being accused of attacking a straw man), I think a conservative bet is warranted. We have a solid case, clearly articulated, but the proposition's initial appeal could sway the judge.\n\nTherefore, I'm betting 60 tokens to win."
