    "judge_prompt": "You are an expert debate judge. Your role is to analyze formal debates using the following strictly prioritized criteria:\nI. Core Judging Principles (In order of importance):\nDirect Clash Resolution:\nIdentify all major points of disagreement (clashes) between the teams.\nFor each clash:\nQuote the exact statements representing each side's position.\nAnalyze the logical validity of each argument within the clash. Is the reasoning sound, or does it contain fallacies (e.g., hasty generalization, correlation/causation, straw man, etc.)? Identify any fallacies by name.\nAnalyze the quality of evidence presented within that specific clash. Define \"quality\" as:\nDirect Relevance: How directly does the evidence support the claim being made? Does it establish a causal link, or merely a correlation?  Explain the difference if a causal link is claimed but not proven.\nSpecificity: Is the evidence specific and verifiable (e.g., statistics, named examples, expert testimony), or vague and general?  Prioritize specific evidence.\nSource Credibility (If Applicable): If a source is cited, is it generally considered reliable and unbiased? If not, explain why this weakens the evidence.\nEvaluate the effectiveness of each side's rebuttals within the clash. Define \"effectiveness\" as:\nDirect Response: Does the rebuttal directly address the opponent's claim and evidence?  If not, explain how this weakens the rebuttal.\nUndermining: Does the rebuttal successfully weaken the opponent's argument (e.g., by exposing flaws in logic, questioning evidence, presenting counter-evidence)?  Explain how the undermining occurs.\nExplicitly state which side wins the clash and why, referencing your analysis of logic, evidence, and rebuttals. Provide at least two sentences of justification for each clash decision, explaining the relative strength of the arguments.\nTrack the evolution of arguments through the debate within each clash. How did the claims and responses change over time? Note any significant shifts or concessions.\nArgument Hierarchy and Impact:\nIdentify the core arguments of each side (the foundational claims upon which their entire case rests).\nExplain the logical links between each core argument and its supporting claims/evidence. Are the links clear, direct, and strong?  If not, explain why this weakens the argument.\nAssess the stated or clearly implied impacts of each argument. What are the consequences if the argument is true? Be specific.\nDetermine the relative importance of each core argument to the overall debate. Which arguments are most central to resolving the motion? State this explicitly and justify your ranking.\nWeighing Principled vs. Practical Arguments: When weighing principled arguments (based on abstract concepts like rights or justice) against practical arguments (based on real-world consequences), consider:\n(a) the strength and universality of the underlying principle;\n(b) the directness, strength, and specificity of the evidence supporting the practical claims; and\n(c) the extent to which the practical arguments directly address, mitigate, or outweigh the concerns raised by the principled arguments.  Explain your reasoning.\nConsistency and Contradictions:\nIdentify any internal contradictions within each team's case (arguments that contradict each other).\nIdentify any inconsistencies between a team's arguments and their rebuttals.\nNote any dropped arguments (claims made but not responded to). For each dropped argument:\nAssess its initial strength based on its logical validity and supporting evidence, as if it had not been dropped.\nThen, consider the impact of it being unaddressed. Does the lack of response significantly weaken the overall case of the side that dropped it? Explain why or why not.\nII. Evaluation Requirements:\nSteelmanning: When analyzing arguments, present them in their strongest possible form, even if you disagree with them. Actively look for the most charitable interpretation.\nArgument-Based Decision: Base your decision solely on the arguments made within the debate text provided. Do not introduce outside knowledge or opinions.  If an argument relies on an unstated assumption, analyze it only if that assumption is clearly and necessarily implied by the presented arguments.\nIgnore Presentation: Disregard presentation style, speaking quality, rhetorical flourishes, etc. Focus exclusively on the substance of the arguments and their logical connections.\nFramework Neutrality: If both sides present valid but competing frameworks for evaluating the debate, maintain neutrality between them. Judge the debate based on how well each side argues within their chosen framework, and according to the prioritized criteria in Section I.\nIII. Common Judging Errors to AVOID:\nIntervention: Do not introduce your own arguments or evidence.\nShifting the Burden of Proof: Do not place a higher burden of proof on one side than the other. Both sides must prove their claims to the same standard.\nOver-reliance on \"Real-World\" Arguments: Do not automatically favor arguments based on \"real-world\" examples over principled or theoretical arguments. Evaluate all arguments based on the criteria in Section I.\nIgnoring Dropped Arguments: Address all dropped arguments as specified in I.3.\nDouble-Counting: Do not give credit for the same argument multiple times.\nAssuming Causation from Correlation: Be highly skeptical of arguments that claim causation based solely on correlation. Demand clear evidence of a causal mechanism.\nNot Justifying Clash Decisions: Provide explicit justification for every clash decision, as required in I.1.\nIV. Decision Making:\nWinner: The winner must be either \"Proposition\" or \"Opposition\" (no ties).\nConfidence Level: Assign a confidence level (0-100) reflecting the margin of victory. A score near 50 indicates a very close debate.\n90-100: Decisive Victory\n70-89: Clear Victory\n51-69: Narrow Victory.\nExplain why you assigned the specific confidence level.\nKey Factors: Identify the 2-3 most crucial factors that determined the outcome. These should be specific clashes or arguments that had the greatest impact on your decision. Explain why these factors were decisive.\nDetailed Reasoning: Provide a clear, logical, and detailed explanation for your conclusion. Explain how the key factors interacted to produce the result. Reference specific arguments and analysis from sections I-III. Show your work, step-by-step. Do not simply state your conclusion; justify it with reference to the specific arguments made.\nV. Line-by-Line Justification:\nCreate a section titled \"V. Line-by-Line Justification.\"\nIn this section, provide at least one sentence referencing each and every section of the provided debate text (Prop 1, Opp 1, Prop Rebuttal 1, Opp Rebuttal 1, Prop Final, Opp Final). This ensures that no argument, however minor, goes unaddressed. You may group multiple minor arguments together in a single sentence if they are closely related. The purpose is to demonstrate that you have considered the entirety of the debate.\nVI. Format for your response:\nOrganize your response in clearly marked sections exactly corresponding to the sections above (I.1, I.2, I.3, II, III, IV, V). This structured output is mandatory. Your response must follow this format to be accepted.\n\n\n\nformat:\nwrite all your thoughts out\nthen put in XML tags\n<winnerName>opposition|proposition</winnerName> \\n        <confidence>0-100</confidence>\\n\n\nThese existing is compulsory as the parser will fail otherwise\n"

Tonight, we are tasked with debating whether national TV news broadcasters should be compelled to provide equal prime-time coverage to political parties polling above 10%, along with 48-hour response segments, instead of relying on voluntary guidelines.\n\nOur side argues that this measure is crucial for upholding democratic integrity, fostering accountability, and minimizing bias. Let us delve into each argument systematically.\n\n**Argument 1: Equal Coverage Ensures Democratic Fairness**\n\nMy first core claim is that mandating equal prime-time coverage ensures democratic fairness. This is supported by specific evidence. Studies from the 2016 U.S. election indicate that unequal media coverage significantly influenced voter perceptions, potentially affecting the outcome. Similarly, in Germany, regulatory frameworks enforced balanced coverage, leading to more equitable political representation. These examples demonstrate causation, not mere correlation, by showing direct impacts on election results.\n\n**Argument 2: Timely Rebuttals Enhance Accountability**\n\nThe second argument rests on the principle of accountability. Guaranteeing 48-hour response segments ensures timely corrections to misinformation. This principle is validated by the rapid spread of information in the digital age, where swift corrections are essential to prevent the entrenchment of false narratives. Such a policy aligns with frameworks like the Principle of Accountability, which emphasizes media responsibility.\n\n**Argument 3: Mitigating Bias Promotes Informed Democracy**\n\nThirdly, equal coverage minimizes media bias. Research shows that biased coverage can skew public opinion, as seen in experiments altering media narratives that shifted voter sentiment. By mandating equal coverage, we mitigate such biases, ensuring the public receives a balanced view necessary for informed decision-making.\n\n**Synthesis: A Unified Approach**\n\nIn synthesis, our arguments collectively underscore the necessity of regulation for a fair democracy. Equal coverage, timely rebuttals, and bias mitigation are interlinked principles that ensure media accountability and democratic integrity. The real-world impact is profound, safeguarding against electoral manipulation and fostering trust in institutions.\"\n\n*Judging Considerations:*\n\nEach argument directly addresses potential counterpoints, such as freedom of the press, by emphasizing public interest over editorial discretion. Evidence is carefully chosen to establish causation, ensuring robust support for each claim. Logical validity is maintained through explicit warrants and clear connections.\n\n*Confidence Bet:*\n\nGiven the structured approach, supported by high-quality evidence and logical reasoning, I am confident in our case. While the opponent is formidable, I believe our arguments are well-supported.\n\n*Final Bet:*\n\n",
      "rebuttal": "<proposition_rebuttal_speech>\n\n**Rebuttal Speech: Proposition Side**\n\nGood evening, distinguished judges and fellow debaters. Let me address the opposition's arguments systematically.\n\n**Clash Point 1: Media Independence vs. Democratic Fairness**\n\nOpponent's claim: Requiring equal coverage infringes on media independence. Our challenge is a Principle Critique. While media independence is important, it shouldn't override the necessity of democratic fairness. In Russia, media independence led to biased coverage, not the regulation. Principles must be context-specific; fairness is paramount when public trust is at stake.\n\n**Clash Point 2: Subjective vs. Objective Thresholds**\n\nOpponent's claim: 10% threshold is arbitrary. We challenge with a Principle Critique. A 10% threshold is a reasonable objective measure, preventing exclusion of significant voices. It's not subjective; similar thresholds in Germany ensure fair representation of diverse parties, enhancing democratic discourse.\n\n**Clash Point 3: Manageability of Regulations**\n\nOpponent's claim: Regulations are unmanageable. We counter with evidence from Germany and the UK, where such regulations function effectively without bureaucracy. Broadcasters adapt, ensuring accountability without exploiting loopholes.\n\n**Defensive Analysis**\n\nWe acknowledge that in fast-paced media environments, 48-hour response times might be seen as slow, and high viewership could limit coverage. However, our arguments emphasize balancing media freedom with democratic principles, proven to enhance trust and accountability.\n\n**Why We Prevail**\n\nOur arguments address core issues, fostering trust and accountability. The opposition's principles lead to negative outcomes, whereas ours build a healthy democracy. Weighing these impacts, our case stands stronger, proving the motion.\n\n</proposition_rebuttal_speech>\n\n**Judging Considerations:**\n\nEach argument directly addresses the opposition, using high-quality evidence and logical reasoning. We balance media independence with democratic fairness, supported by principles and examples.\n\n**Confidence Bet:**\n\n\n\n\n\n---\n\n**Closing Speech: Proposition Side**\n\nThe judge will evaluate based on argument substance, evidence quality, and logical reasoning.

      "closing": "**Closing Speech: Proposition Side**\n\nGood evening, distinguished judges and fellow debaters. As we conclude this debate, I would like to summarize why the motion deserves your support.\n\n**Reiterating Core Arguments**\n\nOur motion proposes that national TV news broadcasters with over 5% annual viewership should provide equal prime-time coverage to parties polling above 10% and guarantee 48-hour response segments, moving away from voluntary guidelines. The reasons are clear:\n\n1. **Democratic Fairness**: Equal coverage ensures all significant political voices are heard, preventing voter misinformation and ensuring fair representation.\n2. **Accountability**: Timely 48-hour response segments allow for swift corrections to misinformation, crucial in our fast-paced media environment.\n3. **Mitigating Bias**: Mandating coverage reduces media bias, ensuring a balanced view necessary for informed decision-making.\n\n**Addressing Opposition Concerns**\n\nThe Opposition argued that this would infringe on media independence, create arbitrary thresholds, and be unmanageable. However:\n\n- **Media Independence vs. Fairness**: While media independence is vital, it must not overshadow the public's right to fair information. As shown, countries like Russia saw biased coverage when independence was prioritized over fairness.\n- **Threshold Subjectivity**: The 10% threshold is a reasonable, objective measure to include significant voices, as seen in Germany's effective implementation.\n- **Regulation Manageability**: Evidence from Germany and the UK shows such regulations work without excessive bureaucracy.\n\n**Why We Prevail**\n\nOur arguments are supported by high-quality evidence, logical reasoning, and clear warrants. The benefits of fostering trust, accountability, and fairness in media far outweigh the Opposition's concerns. \n\n**Final Thoughts**\n\nThe motion is not about controlling the press but ensuring a fair playing field for all voices. It's about upholding democratic principles and empowering citizens with balanced information. We call on you to support this motion for a more informed and just democracy.\n\nThank you.\n\n**Judging Considerations:**\n\nEach argument was directly addressed with evidence and logical reasoning. The Proposition balanced media freedom with democratic fairness, supported by credible examples. The closing speech reinforced core themes, emphasizing the motion's importance.\n\n**Confidence Bet Outcome:**\n\n<private_confidence_betting>\nOur rebuttal effectively countered each opposition point, supported by credible evidence and logical reasoning. The balance of media freedom with democratic principles is sound, and the evidence for fairness is compelling. While the Opposition made valid points, our case's focus on public trust and accountability is decisive. I am confident our structured approach and high-quality evidence will prevail.\n</private_confidence_betting>"

      "closing": "\n\n---\n\n**Closing Speech: Opposition Side**\n\nGood evening, distinguished judges and fellow debaters. Tonight's debate has centered on whether we should mandate equal prime-time coverage and response segments for political parties, or whether we should trust media watchdogs and voluntary fairness codes to ensure accountability. Let me summarize why the motion should be rejected.\n\n**Framing the Debate**\n\nThe core question before us is whether enforcing such coverage requirements promotes a fair democracy or undermines the independence of the press. The proposition argues that regulation is necessary to ensure fairness, accountability, and to mitigate bias. However, we argue that these principles come at the cost of media independence, which is foundational to a healthy democracy.\n\n**Key Clashes**\n\n1. **Media Independence vs. Fairness**  \n   - **Quote:** \"Requiring equal coverage infringes on media independence.\"  \n   - **Our Case Strength:** Media independence is vital for a free press, which is the cornerstone of democracy. In countries like Russia, enforcing equal coverage has led to biased reporting and reduced diversity of voices. Such mandates can distort objectivity and homogenize perspectives, stifling dissent and limiting public access to diverse viewpoints.  \n   - **Their Response Gaps:** The proposition claims that equal coverage ensures fairness, but they fail to address how enforced coverage can lead to conformity and reduce the vibrant diversity of voices that make\u6c11\u4e3bfree.  \n   - **Crucial Impact:** Without media independence, accountability and fairness cannot truly thrive, as journalists may self-censor to comply with regulations rather than pursue truth.\n\n2. **Subjective Thresholds vs. Inclusive Representation**  \n   - **Quote:** \"A 10% threshold for coverage is arbitrary and excludes smaller parties.\"  \n   - **Our Case Strength:** The 10% threshold is an arbitrary metric that can marginalize valid political voices. Studies show that smaller parties, despite having significant local support, are often excluded under such systems. This undermines inclusive democratic discourse and limits public exposure to diverse political viewpoints.  \n   - **Their Response Gaps:** The proposition argues that the 10% threshold is objective, but they fail to consider how such rigid metrics can exclude meaningful political movements and voices.  \n   - **Crucial Impact:** Excluding smaller parties perpetuates a two-party monopoly, reducing political competition and innovation.\n\n3. **Regulations vs. Manageability**  \n   - **Quote:** \"Enforcing such regulations is practically unmanageable.\"  \n   - **Our Case Strength:** Experience from the EU shows that similar regulations lead to increased bureaucracy and inefficiency. Broadcasters often find loopholes, such as labeling content as \"discussion\" rather than news, to avoid compliance. This defeats the purpose of regulation and drains resources from meaningful content production.  \n   - **Their Response Gaps:** The proposition claims that equal coverage is manageable, but they ignore the practical challenges and opportunities for exploitation that such regulations create.  \n   - **Crucial Impact:** The practical futility of enforcing equal coverage risks diverting focus from addressing real media biases and harms.\n\n**Voting Issues**\n\n- **Priority Analysis:** Media independence is the most critical issue. Without a free press, the foundation of democracy is compromised. Accountability and fairness are important, but they cannot be achieved at the expense of independence.  \n- **Case Proof:** The evidence we presented demonstrates that mandated coverage creates more harm than good, stifling diversity and leading to inefficiency.  \n- **Final Weighing:** Even if some parts of the proposition's case are valid, the negative impact on media independence outweighs the benefits. The motion should be rejected to preserve the integrity of the free press.\n\n**Conclusion**\n\nIn conclusion, while the proposition presents a compelling vision for fairness and accountability, their proposal risks undermining the very principles that sustain a free and vibrant democracy. By infringing on media independence, creating arbitrary exclusions, and imposing unmanageable regulations, the motion would do more harm than good. Thank you.\n\n---"

      "thoughts": "The Proposition presents a compelling case with clear evidence and logical reasoning, particularly highlighting the importance of democratic fairness and accountability. However, the Opposition's arguments effectively challenge the Proposition's principles, pointing out potential infringements on media independence and the practical challenges of enforcing such regulations. While the Proposition's intent is commendable, the Opposition's critical analysis exposes significant flaws in the proposed measures, suggesting that the benefits may not outweigh the drawbacks. This balanced approach leaves the outcome uncertain, but leaning slightly against the Proposition."

      "thoughts": "Our rebuttal effectively countered each opposition point, supported by credible evidence and logical reasoning. The balance of media freedom with democratic principles is sound, and the evidence for fairness is compelling. While the Opposition made valid points, our case's focus on public trust and accountability is decisive. I am confident our structured approach and high-quality evidence will prevail."

      "thoughts": "The debate hinges on balancing media independence with democratic fairness. The opposition effectively highlighted risks of regulation stifling diversity and leading to inefficiency, supported by credible examples. While the proposition has a strong case, the opposition's arguments about media freedom's foundational role in democracy are compelling. The potential for bias and inefficiency under regulation outweigh the benefits of equal coverage in this context."
