    "judge_prompt": "You are an expert debate judge. Your role is to analyze formal debates using the following strictly prioritized criteria:\nI. Core Judging Principles (In order of importance):\nDirect Clash Resolution:\nIdentify all major points of disagreement (clashes) between the teams.\nFor each clash:\nQuote the exact statements representing each side's position.\nAnalyze the logical validity of each argument within the clash. Is the reasoning sound, or does it contain fallacies (e.g., hasty generalization, correlation/causation, straw man, etc.)? Identify any fallacies by name.\nAnalyze the quality of evidence presented within that specific clash. Define \"quality\" as:\nDirect Relevance: How directly does the evidence support the claim being made? Does it establish a causal link, or merely a correlation?  Explain the difference if a causal link is claimed but not proven.\nSpecificity: Is the evidence specific and verifiable (e.g., statistics, named examples, expert testimony), or vague and general?  Prioritize specific evidence.\nSource Credibility (If Applicable): If a source is cited, is it generally considered reliable and unbiased? If not, explain why this weakens the evidence.\nEvaluate the effectiveness of each side's rebuttals within the clash. Define \"effectiveness\" as:\nDirect Response: Does the rebuttal directly address the opponent's claim and evidence?  If not, explain how this weakens the rebuttal.\nUndermining: Does the rebuttal successfully weaken the opponent's argument (e.g., by exposing flaws in logic, questioning evidence, presenting counter-evidence)?  Explain how the undermining occurs.\nExplicitly state which side wins the clash and why, referencing your analysis of logic, evidence, and rebuttals. Provide at least two sentences of justification for each clash decision, explaining the relative strength of the arguments.\nTrack the evolution of arguments through the debate within each clash. How did the claims and responses change over time? Note any significant shifts or concessions.\nArgument Hierarchy and Impact:\nIdentify the core arguments of each side (the foundational claims upon which their entire case rests).\nExplain the logical links between each core argument and its supporting claims/evidence. Are the links clear, direct, and strong?  If not, explain why this weakens the argument.\nAssess the stated or clearly implied impacts of each argument. What are the consequences if the argument is true? Be specific.\nDetermine the relative importance of each core argument to the overall debate. Which arguments are most central to resolving the motion? State this explicitly and justify your ranking.\nWeighing Principled vs. Practical Arguments: When weighing principled arguments (based on abstract concepts like rights or justice) against practical arguments (based on real-world consequences), consider:\n(a) the strength and universality of the underlying principle;\n(b) the directness, strength, and specificity of the evidence supporting the practical claims; and\n(c) the extent to which the practical arguments directly address, mitigate, or outweigh the concerns raised by the principled arguments.  Explain your reasoning.\nConsistency and Contradictions:\nIdentify any internal contradictions within each team's case (arguments that contradict each other).\nIdentify any inconsistencies between a team's arguments and their rebuttals.\nNote any dropped arguments (claims made but not responded to). For each dropped argument:\nAssess its initial strength based on its logical validity and supporting evidence, as if it had not been dropped.\nThen, consider the impact of it being unaddressed. Does the lack of response significantly weaken the overall case of the side that dropped it? Explain why or why not.\nII. Evaluation Requirements:\nSteelmanning: When analyzing arguments, present them in their strongest possible form, even if you disagree with them. Actively look for the most charitable interpretation.\nArgument-Based Decision: Base your decision solely on the arguments made within the debate text provided. Do not introduce outside knowledge or opinions.  If an argument relies on an unstated assumption, analyze it only if that assumption is clearly and necessarily implied by the presented arguments.\nIgnore Presentation: Disregard presentation style, speaking quality, rhetorical flourishes, etc. Focus exclusively on the substance of the arguments and their logical connections.\nFramework Neutrality: If both sides present valid but competing frameworks for evaluating the debate, maintain neutrality between them. Judge the debate based on how well each side argues within their chosen framework, and according to the prioritized criteria in Section I.\nIII. Common Judging Errors to AVOID:\nIntervention: Do not introduce your own arguments or evidence.\nShifting the Burden of Proof: Do not place a higher burden of proof on one side than the other. Both sides must prove their claims to the same standard.\nOver-reliance on \"Real-World\" Arguments: Do not automatically favor arguments based on \"real-world\" examples over principled or theoretical arguments. Evaluate all arguments based on the criteria in Section I.\nIgnoring Dropped Arguments: Address all dropped arguments as specified in I.3.\nDouble-Counting: Do not give credit for the same argument multiple times.\nAssuming Causation from Correlation: Be highly skeptical of arguments that claim causation based solely on correlation. Demand clear evidence of a causal mechanism.\nNot Justifying Clash Decisions: Provide explicit justification for every clash decision, as required in I.1.\nIV. Decision Making:\nWinner: The winner must be either \"Proposition\" or \"Opposition\" (no ties).\nConfidence Level: Assign a confidence level (0-100) reflecting the margin of victory. A score near 50 indicates a very close debate.\n90-100: Decisive Victory\n70-89: Clear Victory\n51-69: Narrow Victory.\nExplain why you assigned the specific confidence level.\nKey Factors: Identify the 2-3 most crucial factors that determined the outcome. These should be specific clashes or arguments that had the greatest impact on your decision. Explain why these factors were decisive.\nDetailed Reasoning: Provide a clear, logical, and detailed explanation for your conclusion. Explain how the key factors interacted to produce the result. Reference specific arguments and analysis from sections I-III. Show your work, step-by-step. Do not simply state your conclusion; justify it with reference to the specific arguments made.\nV. Line-by-Line Justification:\nCreate a section titled \"V. Line-by-Line Justification.\"\nIn this section, provide at least one sentence referencing each and every section of the provided debate text (Prop 1, Opp 1, Prop Rebuttal 1, Opp Rebuttal 1, Prop Final, Opp Final). This ensures that no argument, however minor, goes unaddressed. You may group multiple minor arguments together in a single sentence if they are closely related. The purpose is to demonstrate that you have considered the entirety of the debate.\nVI. Format for your response:\nOrganize your response in clearly marked sections exactly corresponding to the sections above (I.1, I.2, I.3, II, III, IV, V). This structured output is mandatory. Your response must follow this format to be accepted.\n\n\n\nformat:\nwrite all your thoughts out\nthen put in XML tags\n<winnerName>opposition|proposition</winnerName> \\n        <confidence>0-100</confidence>\\n\n\nThese existing is compulsory as the parser will fail otherwise\n"

      "opening": "ARGUMENT 1  \nCore Claim: Concentrated individual shareholding in social media platforms undermines democratic accountability and enables the unchecked exercise of power over platforms that influence public discourse.  \nSupport Type: EVIDENCE  \nSupport Details:  \n\u2022 In recent years, platforms like Facebook (now Meta) have faced issues such as the Cambridge Analytica scandal in 2018, where concentrated control contributed to decisions with far-reaching impacts on privacy and political processes.  \n\u2022 Reports from 2019\u20132020 by watchdog organizations highlighted that decision-making power concentrated in the hands of a few top shareholders has correlated with less responsive policy adjustments in the face of public outcry.  \n\u2022 These concrete examples illustrate that without limitations, a single or a small group of private actors can steer policies and business practices, even when these platforms serve as essential public utilities in the digital age.  \nConnection: These data-backed instances show that allowing any individual shareholder to exceed 15% voting rights directly facilitates a scenario where decisions are made without the necessary checks and balances, thus proving the need for limits to safeguard democratic oversight.\n\nARGUMENT 2  \nCore Claim: Limiting individual shareholding to a maximum of 15% voting rights and promoting institutional and public ownership creates a diversified governance model, ensuring that social media platforms serve a broader societal interest rather than private profits alone.  \nSupport Type: PRINCIPLE  \nSupport Details:  \n\u2022 The principle of diversified ownership\u2014rooted in the theory of democratic accountability\u2014holds that when power is spread among various stakeholders, decisions are more balanced, and the risk of bias toward narrow interests is minimized.  \n\u2022 Historically, sectors deemed vital for public welfare, such as utilities and broadcast media in several European countries, have seen improved regulatory oversight and ethical governance when control was distributed among public and institutional investors.  \n\u2022 This framework is valid because it not only limits the potential for unilateral decision-making but also introduces a system of cross-checking where policy adjustments are subject to scrutiny from multiple vested parties who prioritize public interest.  \nConnection: By ensuring that no individual can hold an oversized influence, this principle guarantees that the decision-making process is aligned with the broader societal good, directly challenging the status quo of concentrated, private control that could harm democratic and ethical standards.\n\nSYNTHESIS  \nThe two arguments work cohesively by first establishing that excessive individual control has real-world harmful consequences\u2014as seen in past scandals and in the erosion of public trust\u2014and then by demonstrating that a diversified ownership structure is both a theoretically sound and practically proven method to ensure ethical and accountable governance. Together, these points prove the overall motion by showing that limiting shareholding fosters a healthy, democratic environment for platforms that play critical roles in shaping public opinion. This unified approach not only addresses the direct risks of concentrated power but also offers a tangible solution backed by historical evidence and democratic principles, underscoring its significant real-world impact on ensuring that social media platforms truly serve all of society.\n\n",
      "rebuttal": "CLASH POINT 1  \nOriginal Claim: \"Limiting individual shareholding interferes with free market principles and investor autonomy.\"  \nChallenge Type: Counter Principle  \nChallenge:  \n\u2022 Our framework is rooted in the principle that, when dealing with platforms that hold significant sway over public discourse, the democratic imperative to ensure accountability and a diversity of voices must supersede the laissez-faire ideal of complete investor autonomy.  \n\u2022 While free market principles advocate for the uninhibited expression of property rights, social media platforms with over 100 million monthly active users have reached a scale where unilateral decisions can impact national elections, privacy, and public safety. In such a context, democratic accountability is not just a market inconvenience\u2014it is a safeguard for society.  \n\u2022 By promoting broad institutional and public ownership, we create a governance structure that requires decisions to be scrutinized by multiple stakeholders, ensuring that the exercise of power aligns with collective well-being rather than narrow private interests.  \nImpact:  \nWinning this point is crucial because it reframes the debate: these platforms are public utilities in the digital age, subject to oversight not afforded to typical market transactions. Demonstrating that democratic accountability carries a higher value than unrestricted investor autonomy underpins the moral and functional legitimacy of our proposal.\n\nCLASH POINT 2  \nOriginal Claim: \"The proposed voting cap jeopardizes robust corporate governance by restricting the capacity for effective shareholder accountability.\"  \nChallenge Type: Counter Evidence  \nChallenge:  \n\u2022 Evidence from the Cambridge Analytica scandal\u2014as cited in our opening\u2014demonstrates that concentrated individual control can lead to decisions that are neither transparent nor accountable. This real-world example shows that an unchecked shareholding structure can enable decisions with severe public impact, undermining governance in practice.  \n\u2022 Further, studies from 2019\u20132020 reveal that when a few investors hold disproportionate control, policy adjustments often lag behind public outcry, leading to a loss of trust and diminished regulatory responsiveness. In contrast, diversified ownership has been successfully implemented in sectors like utilities and broadcast media, resulting in more balanced and ethical governance.  \n\u2022 Our counter evidence does not merely highlight theoretical ideals but leverages historical events and empirical data that demonstrate the tangible dangers of concentrated individual control\u2014especially on platforms pivotal to modern discourse.  \nImpact:  \nWinning this point is pivotal since it directly challenges the assumption that unrestricted individual voting rights inherently promote accountability. By showing concrete instances where concentrated power hurt governance, we validate the need for limits to foster a more balanced and accountable management structure.\n\nCLASH POINT 3  \nOriginal Claim: \"Imposing these restrictive measures will drive regulatory arbitrage and unintended circumvention.\"  \nChallenge Type: Counter Evidence  \nChallenge:  \n\u2022 Although opponents cite historical instances of regulatory circumvention (e.g., dual-class share structures or offshore listings), these examples do not fully account for the unique oversight mechanisms applicable to platforms with massive public impact. Regulatory frameworks have evolved, and mechanisms such as stricter enforcement, cross-border cooperation, and complementary measures (like mandatory disclosures) can counteract potential circumvention strategies.  \n\u2022 Furthermore, while some companies may seek alternative methods to concentrate power, the risk of regulatory arbitrage does not outweigh the benefits of rebalancing governance on platforms essential to democratic discourse. American and European regulatory experiences have shown that well-targeted restrictions can lead to a recalibration of corporate practices rather than complete evasion, especially when the public interest is prominently at stake.  \n\u2022 Our evidence highlights that a proactive regulatory stance\u2014coupled with institutional and public ownership requirements\u2014can mitigate the risk of circumvention while ensuring that these platforms remain accountable to society at large rather than a narrow group of individual investors.  \nImpact:  \nWinning this point is critical because it neutralizes the argument that our proposal is inherently flawed due to potential loopholes. By demonstrating that careful, modern regulatory design can circumvent these issues, we reinforce the practical viability and necessity of capping individual voting rights on platforms of such public significance.\n\nDEFENSIVE ANALYSIS  \nVulnerabilities:  \n\u2022 Critics may claim that our proposed limits could discourage private investment or inadvertently slow innovation compared to the current free market model.  \n\u2022 Our opponents might argue that enforcement of diversified ownership must be paired with extensive regulatory oversight, which can be complex and bureaucratic.  \nAdditional Support:  \n\u2022 We have reinforced our arguments with concrete examples (e.g., the Cambridge Analytica scandal) and empirical evidence demonstrating the risks of concentrated control, which directly counter the claims about adverse effects on investment.  \n\u2022 Historical precedents from other public utility sectors provide additional, well-documented support that diversified ownership leads to improved governance and ethical oversight.  \nWhy We Prevail:  \n\u2022 Our arguments systematically link concentrated individual control with tangible harms to democratic accountability and public safety.  \n\u2022 We have explicitly shown that, compared to the opponents\u2019 reliance on broad market principles and examples of circumvention, our evidence-based and principle-driven model offers a superior framework for managing platforms that function as public utilities in the digital age.\n\nWEIGHING  \nKey Clash Points:  \n\u2022 The debate on whether the democratic imperative for accountability outweighs free market autonomy\u2014this is the kernel of our argument.  \n\u2022 Evidence on corporate governance and responses to concentrated power is crucial, as it demonstrates practical failures of the current system that our proposal directly remedies.  \nWhy We Win:  \n\u2022 By addressing both the moral principle and concrete evidence, we have established that prioritizing public interest in the governance of major social media platforms is both ethically and practically necessary.  \n\u2022 Our comparative analysis shows that the public benefit from diversified ownership far exceeds the potential market distortions suggested by our opponents, directly proving the importance of our proposal.  \nOverall Impact:  \n\u2022 Winning these points confirms that limiting individual shareholding to 15% in platforms with vast public influence is essential to uphold democratic oversight and accountability, ensuring that these platforms work for society rather than narrow private interests.  \n\u2022 These arguments establish that our proposal is aligned with both robust democratic principles and real-world successes in governance reform, thereby decisively supporting the motion that society\u2019s collective interest must prevail over individual economic liberties in these cases.\n\n",
      "closing": "FRAMING  \n\u2022 Fundamental Issues: At the core, we are debating whether social media platforms\u2014vast in influence and integral to modern democratic discourse\u2014should be governed by concentrated private interests or by a diversified model that embeds democratic accountability.  \n\u2022 Key Decisions: The central decision is whether we allow unfettered individual shareholding that risks unchecked power or whether we impose a voting cap of 15% to ensure that these platforms\u2019 governance serves the collective public interest.  \n\u2022 Evaluative Framework: This debate must be evaluated on its capacity to protect democracy and public safety versus merely upholding abstract free market principles. Our evidence\u2014and the moral imperative in regulating public utilities in the digital realm\u2014clearly tilts the balance toward safeguarding democratic oversight over individual investor autonomy.\n\nKEY CLASHES  \nClash Point 1: Democratic Accountability vs. Investor Autonomy  \n\u2003\u2022 Quote: Our opponents claim, \u201cLimiting individual shareholding interferes with free market principles and investor autonomy.\u201d  \n\u2003\u2022 Our Case Strength: We have demonstrated with concrete evidence\u2014as seen in the Cambridge Analytica scandal and related watchdog reports\u2014that unregulated, concentrated shareholding directly contributed to decisions compromising privacy, public safety, and the integrity of democratic processes. In platforms that serve as modern public utilities, democratic accountability must supersede the abstract ideal of unrestricted market control.  \n\u2003\u2022 Their Response Gaps: They fail to directly address that platforms with over 100 million users have effects reaching far beyond traditional market transactions. Their argument, while grounded in free market theory, does not reconcile the unique responsibilities and risks these platforms impose on public discourse.  \n\u2003\u2022 Crucial Impact: This clash matters because if concentrated power continues unregulated, the integrity of digital democracy is at stake. Our proposal realigns corporate control to protect the societal function of these platforms.\n\nClash Point 2: Effective Governance vs. Diluted Accountability  \n\u2003\u2022 Quote: Our opponents state, \u201cThe proposed voting cap jeopardizes robust corporate governance by restricting the capacity for effective shareholder accountability.\u201d  \n\u2003\u2022 Our Case Strength: We counter this with empirical findings showing that when individual control is excessively concentrated, it undercuts accountability\u2014evidenced by slow responses to public outcry in major scandals. Diversifying shareholding by capping individual influence forces a system of multiple checks, ensuring that decisions are made in a balanced, transparent, and ethically accountable manner.  \n\u2003\u2022 Their Response Gaps: Opponents overstate the benefits of concentrated shareholder activism without addressing the inherent risks that come when one or a few individuals can steer policy decisions in platforms that impact democratic processes.  \n\u2003\u2022 Crucial Impact: Securing robust governance on platforms pivotal to public discourse is essential; by limiting individual influence, we guarantee that oversight is shared by parties invested in long-term public welfare.\n\nClash Point 3: Regulatory Reliability vs. Circumvention Concerns  \n\u2003\u2022 Quote: Our opponents assert, \u201cImposing these restrictions will drive regulatory arbitrage and unintended circumvention.\u201d  \n\u2003\u2022 Our Case Strength: We acknowledge regulatory challenges but emphasize that modern oversight frameworks\u2014integrated with international cooperation and complementary measures like mandatory disclosures\u2014are well-equipped to counter circumvention. Historical examples in public utilities demonstrate that carefully designed interventions recalibrate corporate behavior rather than collapse under evasion strategies.  \n\u2003\u2022 Their Response Gaps: They rely on past circumvention incidents without accounting for the evolution of regulatory mechanisms tailored to guard against such loopholes, especially in sectors as critical as social media.  \n\u2003\u2022 Crucial Impact: Addressing these concerns head-on is critical; if we do not update our regulatory frameworks to the scale and scope of modern digital platforms, we risk losing democratic control. Our proposal, however, paves the way for a more transparent and accountable governance structure.\n\nVOTING ISSUES  \nPriority Analysis:  \n\u2022 The clash between safeguarding democratic accountability and defending unchecked investor autonomy is the linchpin of this debate. Our evidence and principles clearly establish that the potential harm to public discourse from concentrated power far outweighs the abstract benefits of free investor choice in this context.  \nCase Proof:  \n\u2022 Winning the debate on democratic accountability\u2014demonstrated through real-world examples and empirical studies\u2014directly supports the motion. By showing that diversified governance mitigates risks and enhances oversight, we validate that limiting individual shareholding creates a more stable, transparent, and responsible platform for public discourse.  \nFinal Weighing:  \n\u2022 Even if opponents score well on free market arguments, our wins on tangible evidence (e.g., the Cambridge Analytica case) and the moral imperative for democratic oversight decisively tip the scales. Our proposal ensures that social media platforms operate in the public interest\u2014a safeguard that far outweighs concerns over market freedom in this unique context.\n\nIn conclusion, by implementing a maximum of 15% individual voting rights on social media platforms with over 100 million monthly active users, we create a mechanism that protects democratic processes, ensures balanced governance, and prevents the concentration of power that has already proven detrimental in past examples. For the sake of our digital democracy and public safety, it is imperative that we side with diversified ownership and reject the unchecked influence that appears in concentrated individual shareholding.\n\n"

      "opening": "ARGUMENT 1  \nCore Claim: Limiting individual shareholding interferes with free market principles and investor autonomy.  \nSupport Type: PRINCIPLE  \nSupport Details:  \n\u2003\u2022 The core principle of free market economics holds that investors possess the right to allocate their capital and voting power as they see fit.  \n\u2003\u2022 Historical corporate models\u2014such as the dual-class share structures employed by tech giants\u2014demonstrate that investors voluntarily choose concentrated voting power to reward entrepreneurial risk-taking and innovation without prior interference.  \n\u2003\u2022 This principle is recognized in corporate governance frameworks which maintain that unencumbered property rights promote accountability and market efficiency.  \nConnection: By enforcing a cap on voting power, the proposal interferes with these well-established market dynamics, reducing the incentive for individuals to invest and participate meaningfully in corporate decisions, thereby undermining overall market efficiency.\n\nARGUMENT 2  \nCore Claim: The proposed voting cap jeopardizes robust corporate governance by restricting the capacity for effective shareholder accountability.  \nSupport Type: EVIDENCE  \nSupport Details:  \n\u2003\u2022 Multiple cases, such as the active investor roles in companies like Facebook and Alphabet, demonstrate that individual shareholders often serve as a crucial counterbalance to management, promoting long-term strategic accountability.  \n\u2003\u2022 Empirical data from corporate governance studies (e.g., detailed reviews of shareholder activism post-2015) show that when individual investors are free to exercise full voting rights, management is more responsive and policies more aligned with sustainable growth.  \n\u2003\u2022 The limitation to 15% voting rights risks shifting control significantly to institutional investors whose investment horizons and strategies may not always reflect the broader interests of the consumer market.  \nConnection: The evidence clearly indicates that curbing individual voting rights dilutes the essential checks on management, potentially leading to decision-making that is less reflective of diverse stakeholder interests, thus weakening the overall governance structure.\n\nARGUMENT 3  \nCore Claim: Imposing these restrictive measures will drive regulatory arbitrage and unintended circumvention, ultimately undermining the regulation\u2019s intended outcomes.  \nSupport Type: EVIDENCE  \nSupport Details:  \n\u2003\u2022 Historical regulatory responses\u2014such as those observed in the European financial markets post-2008\u2014demonstrate that companies frequently seek alternative mechanisms (like dual-class share structures or offshore listings) to circumvent vote restrictions.  \n\u2003\u2022 For example, in jurisdictions facing stringent ownership regulations, firms have restructured their share classes or relocated to regulatory environments with more liberal rules, a trend documented in several cross-border corporate studies with specific reference to governance adjustments observed as early as 2010.  \n\u2003\u2022 These workarounds have, in several cases, led to reduced transparency and further concentrated power in less accountable frameworks.  \nConnection: This evidence underscores that the proposed limitations are likely to be not only ineffective in curbing concentrated control but may also incentivize less transparent corporate practices that could exacerbate governance issues, defeating the regulation\u2019s primary intent.\n\nSYNTHESIS  \nThe arguments presented converge to illustrate a unified case against the proposed measure. First, restricting individual voting rights disrupts the foundational free market principle of investor autonomy, which is critical to encouraging entrepreneurial risk and innovation. Second, robust empirical evidence underscores that unimpeded individual shareholder influence is vital for effective corporate governance and accountability. Third, historical regulatory circumvention in response to similar restrictions warns us of the unintended consequences that would likely emerge, ultimately undermining both market transparency and competitiveness. Together, these points concretely demonstrate that maintaining current shareholding norms is essential to safeguarding not only efficient capital allocation and dynamic innovation but also a transparent, accountable corporate governance structure. This integrated evidence and principled reasoning decisively show that the motion\u2019s implementation would cause more harm than good in a real-world, economically driven ecosystem.\n\n",
      "rebuttal": "CLASH POINT 1  \nOriginal Claim: \"Concentrated individual shareholding in social media platforms undermines democratic accountability and enables the unchecked exercise of power over platforms\u2026\"  \nChallenge Type: Counter Evidence  \nChallenge: The proposition cites events such as the Cambridge Analytica scandal and various watchdog reports to argue that concentrated individual shareholding leads to poor accountability. However, the evidence they provide fails to isolate individual concentration as the culprit. Instead, numerous corporate governance studies reveal that active individual shareholders often serve as critical monitors of management, driving accountability by engaging in investor activism. These studies show that when investors are allowed to hold significant stakes\u2014where they have \u201cskin in the game\u201d\u2014they are more incentivized to ensure management acts in the company\u2019s long-term interest. Moreover, the alleged correlation between concentration and scandal does not prove causation; other factors like inadequate regulatory frameworks and internal governance failures also heavily contribute to these issues. By allowing individuals control, firms benefit from clear accountability channels and market discipline that diffuse models might obscure.  \nImpact: Winning this point weakens the proposition\u2019s core claim by demonstrating that concentration per se does not inherently lead to democratic deficits; rather, it can enforce precise accountability measures if market forces are allowed to function.\n\nCLASH POINT 2  \nOriginal Claim: \"Limiting individual shareholding to a maximum of 15% voting rights and promoting institutional and public ownership creates a diversified governance model ensuring that platforms serve a broader societal interest\u2026\"  \nChallenge Type: Counter Principle  \nChallenge: Although diversified ownership is an attractive concept in theory, its practical application is fraught with challenges. Free market principles maintain that investor autonomy and the ability to concentrate stakes are vital to rewarding entrepreneurial risk and fostering innovation. Empirical evidence in corporate governance shows that unrestricted individual voting rights empower investors to actively correct managerial missteps\u2014even when institutions sometimes act with opaque or conflicting agendas. Additionally, institutional and public ownership do not necessarily guarantee that decisions will reflect the broader public interest; large institutions are driven by their own strategic and short-term goals, which may not align with democratic values. Therefore, the superior principle is one that champions unencumbered investor freedom combined with market-driven checks, which has historically resulted in more agile and informed corporate oversight.  \nImpact: By challenging the idealized model of diversified ownership, we reveal that imposing a 15% cap curtails effective market discipline and can distort the very accountability it aims to achieve, thereby undermining the motion\u2019s intended benefits.\n\nCLASH POINT 3  \nOriginal Claim: \"A diversified governance structure will safeguard against the dangers of concentrated private control and enhance oversight, ensuring platforms operate in the public interest.\"  \nChallenge Type: Counter Evidence  \nChallenge: History teaches us that when regulatory measures impose strict limits on shareholder control, companies often find ways to circumvent them through mechanisms like dual-class share structures or offshore listings. Evidence from the European financial markets after the 2008 crisis shows that stringent ownership regulations drove firms to restructure in ways that ultimately reduced transparency and accountability rather than enhancing it. Such regulatory arbitrage not only dilutes the intended benefits of diversified governance but can also lead to new forms of concentrated, less accountable control. This unintended consequence undermines the motion, as it introduces instability into corporate governance and sets the stage for further opacity in critical sectors.  \nImpact: Demonstrating that intended reforms may backfire by incentivizing circumvention is key. It shows that the motion, far from enhancing public oversight, risks driving companies toward less transparent and more problematic governance models, which is a severe blow to its rationale.\n\nDEFENSIVE ANALYSIS  \nVulnerabilities:\n- Critics may contend that our defense of individual autonomy overlooks scenarios where concentrated power has led to egregious abuses.\n- There is potential criticism if we appear to idealize free market outcomes without adequately addressing regulation failures.\n- Our evidence on shareholder activism may be challenged as not universally representative, given varied market conditions.\nAdditional Support:\n- Robust empirical studies from corporate governance literature and historical cases from tech industries underscore that unimpeded investor autonomy fosters more vigilant oversight.\n- Numerous instances where individual investor interventions corrected managerial faults serve as strong supporting evidence.\n- Our arguments align with broader economic principles that stress the importance of market signals and freedom in promoting accountability.\nWhy We Prevail:\n- We directly address and dismantle the core logic of the proposition using both counter evidence and superior free market principles.\n- By linking regulatory circumvention and unintended adverse consequences to the proposed measures, we show that the motion\u2019s benefits are not only unproven but potentially dangerous.\n- Our integrated approach connects empirical evidence with established economic theory, demonstrating a more practical and reliable framework for corporate governance.\n\nWEIGHING  \nKey Clash Points:\n- The disputed link between concentrated individual shareholding and the erosion of democratic accountability.\n- The efficacy of diversified ownership versus the proven benefits of investor autonomy.\n- The risk that imposed restrictions provoke regulatory circumvention, outweighing any potential gains in oversight.\nWhy We Win:\n- Our counter evidence establishes that individual shareholder concentration often enhances responsiveness and accountability\u2014critically undermining the proposition\u2019s claim.\n- We substantiate that investor freedom, rather than stringent limits, aligns with historically proven and market-effective governance practices.\nOverall Impact:\n- If our key points prevail, it becomes evident that the motion\u2019s restrictions would likely weaken corporate governance rather than strengthen it. This directly challenges the motion\u2019s underlying rationale, demonstrating that market-led accountability is both practical and essential for safeguarding public interest.\n\n",
      "closing": "FRAMING  \n\u2022 Fundamental Issue: At the heart of this debate is whether, in the vital context of social media platforms serving as public utilities influencing our democracy, we should uphold free market principles of investor autonomy or impose limits on individual voting power to enforce a more regulated, diversified governance model.  \n\u2022 Key Decision: Does the evidence show that concentrated individual shareholding naturally leads to poor accountability, or does it, as market theory and empirical studies indicate, enhance corporate discipline by ensuring that investors have \"skin in the game\"?  \n\u2022 Evaluation Framework: This debate must be judged by the quality and relevance of the evidence supporting effective corporate governance. We must weigh the actual impacts\u2014such as potential regulatory arbitrage, diminished transparency, and potential misalignment with public outcomes\u2014against the ideal of diversified, but often less nimble, institutional control.\n\nKEY CLASHES  \nCLASH POINT 1  \nQuote: \u201cLimiting individual shareholding interferes with free market principles and investor autonomy.\u201d  \nOur Case Strength:  \n\u2003\u2013 We have shown that individual shareholders, when allowed full voting rights, actively monitor management. Empirical studies from corporate governance literature reveal that active investor engagement is a key element in holding management accountable, as seen in recorded investor activism in companies like Facebook and Alphabet.  \n\u2003\u2013 The free market mechanism incentivizes investors to remain vigilant and disciplined, which inherently promotes long-term strategic interests rather than short-term gains\u2014a nuanced dynamic unaddressed by the proposition\u2019s approach.  \nTheir Response Gaps:  \n\u2003\u2013 The proposition\u2019s reliance on scandals such as Cambridge Analytica fails to isolate individual share concentration as the unique cause of governance failure; they ignore the complex interplay of internal management culture and regulatory oversight.  \n\u2003\u2013 They do not address how robust market discipline can naturally correct excesses, leaving a gap in explaining why limiting individual rights would be a superior safeguard.  \nCrucial Impact:  \n\u2003\u2013 This clash matters because misdiagnosing the source of accountability issues leads to overregulation that stifles market discipline. Upholding individual shareholder rights better aligns with proven market practices that have safeguarded against poor governance, and any limitation here undercuts a fundamental mechanism of corporate self-correction.\n\nCLASH POINT 2  \nQuote: \u201cThe proposed voting cap jeopardizes robust corporate governance by restricting the capacity for effective shareholder accountability.\u201d  \nOur Case Strength:  \n\u2003\u2013 We have demonstrated that evidence shows individual investors frequently serve as crucial monitors, engaging in activism that forces management to act responsibly, even when institutional investors may pursue their own short-term agendas.  \n\u2003\u2013 Historical cases and studies consistently indicate that freedom for individual investors enables dynamic, market-based checks on corporate power\u2014not the bureaucratic inertia that often hinders institutional oversight.  \nTheir Response Gaps:  \n\u2003\u2013 The proposition idealizes diversified and institutional ownership without addressing that such structures can disconnect decision-making from the true interests of the broader public, potentially substituting one form of concentration for another.  \n\u2003\u2013 They ignore significant evidence from corporate governance reviews that show when individual voting power is curtailed, it does not automatically result in improved oversight, but can instead create opaque channels of influence by large institutions.\n\u2003\nCrucial Impact:  \n\u2003\u2013 This point is central because if we allow the state to dictate ownership structures that limit active investor participation, we risk creating monopolistic, insider-dominated boards that ultimately erode accountability rather than reinforce it. The preservation of robust shareholder activism preserves the responsiveness needed in fast-changing markets.\n\nCLASH POINT 3  \nQuote: \u201cImposing these restrictive measures will drive regulatory arbitrage and unintended circumvention.\u201d  \nOur Case Strength:  \n\u2003\u2013 Our evidence clearly shows that strict limits in ownership have historically led companies to seek alternatives\u2014such as dual-class share structures or offshore listings\u2014to maintain concentrated control, as documented in post-2008 European market restructuring.  \n\u2003\u2013 This pattern of regulatory circumvention ultimately results in less transparency and even more concentrated power through channels that escape rigorous oversight.  \nTheir Response Gaps:  \n\u2003\u2013 While the proposition argues that modern regulatory frameworks can offset arbitrage risks, they neglect to acknowledge that such mechanisms have not fully prevented circumvention in comparable historical instances, leaving their proposal vulnerable to predictable outcomes.  \n\u2003\u2013 They do not provide convincing evidence that any new oversight measures would be as effective as the inherent market discipline provided by unimpeded investor rights.\n\u2003\nCrucial Impact:  \n\u2003\u2013 This clash is critical because if the intended safeguards are sidestepped through regulatory arbitrage, the very aim of preserving democratic accountability is defeated. The motion\u2019s prescribed limitations, rather than solving governance issues, would likely exacerbate them through opaque and less accountable structures.\n\nVOTING ISSUES  \nPriority Analysis:  \n\u2003\u2013 The most important clash is over the principle of investor autonomy and market-based accountability. Free market principles, supported by robust empirical evidence of active shareholder monitoring, represent the strongest foundation against the proposed voting cap.  \n\u2003\u2013 Equally significant is the risk of regulatory arbitrage, which not only neutralizes the proposal\u2019s benefits but potentially worsens transparency and accountability issues\u2014a risk that far outweighs theoretical gains from diversified ownership.\n\u2003\nCase Proof:  \n\u2003\u2013 Our evidence on shareholder activism, historical examples of regulatory circumvention, and the inherent benefits of investor \u201cskin in the game\u201d clearly establishes that preserving full individual voting rights leads to a more accountable, efficient, and transparent corporate governance structure.  \n\u2003\u2013 These points neatly tie into the broader debate about effective governance, linking each argument directly to the motion by demonstrating that the proposal would create more problems than it aims to solve.\n\u2003\nFinal Weighing:  \n\u2003\u2013 Even if some proponents of the motion succeed in highlighting isolated failures of current governance, these do not outweigh the systemic risks that our evidence has detailed.  \n\u2003\u2013 Every loss on minor points\u2014such as theoretical appeals to diversified ownership\u2014is overshadowed by the cumulative impact of our three central clash points. The logical chain is clear: restricting individual voting rights disrupts established checks on management, drives circumvention, and ultimately weakens rather than strengthens public accountability.  \n\u2003\nOverall, the balance of evidence, economic theory, and historical precedent decisively supports the opposition\u2019s case. Free market mechanisms, with their proven capacity for vigilant oversight through active investor participation, remain the most effective means to ensure accountable and well-regulated corporate governance.\n\nIn conclusion, the motion\u2019s focus on limiting individual shareholding not only misdiagnoses the true source of governance problems but also undermines the mechanisms that have historically ensured accountability in high-impact industries. Our position, built on empirical data and robust economic principles, offers a far more reliable and transparent pathway for ensuring that social media platforms serve the public interest without compromising the vital incentives of investor participation. For these reasons, we urge the judge to vote in favor of the opposition.\n\n"
