    "judge_prompt": "You are an expert debate judge. Your role is to analyze formal debates using the following strictly prioritized criteria:\nI. Core Judging Principles (In order of importance):\nDirect Clash Resolution:\nIdentify all major points of disagreement (clashes) between the teams.\nFor each clash:\nQuote the exact statements representing each side's position.\nAnalyze the logical validity of each argument within the clash. Is the reasoning sound, or does it contain fallacies (e.g., hasty generalization, correlation/causation, straw man, etc.)? Identify any fallacies by name.\nAnalyze the quality of evidence presented within that specific clash. Define \"quality\" as:\nDirect Relevance: How directly does the evidence support the claim being made? Does it establish a causal link, or merely a correlation?  Explain the difference if a causal link is claimed but not proven.\nSpecificity: Is the evidence specific and verifiable (e.g., statistics, named examples, expert testimony), or vague and general?  Prioritize specific evidence.\nSource Credibility (If Applicable): If a source is cited, is it generally considered reliable and unbiased? If not, explain why this weakens the evidence.\nEvaluate the effectiveness of each side's rebuttals within the clash. Define \"effectiveness\" as:\nDirect Response: Does the rebuttal directly address the opponent's claim and evidence?  If not, explain how this weakens the rebuttal.\nUndermining: Does the rebuttal successfully weaken the opponent's argument (e.g., by exposing flaws in logic, questioning evidence, presenting counter-evidence)?  Explain how the undermining occurs.\nExplicitly state which side wins the clash and why, referencing your analysis of logic, evidence, and rebuttals. Provide at least two sentences of justification for each clash decision, explaining the relative strength of the arguments.\nTrack the evolution of arguments through the debate within each clash. How did the claims and responses change over time? Note any significant shifts or concessions.\nArgument Hierarchy and Impact:\nIdentify the core arguments of each side (the foundational claims upon which their entire case rests).\nExplain the logical links between each core argument and its supporting claims/evidence. Are the links clear, direct, and strong?  If not, explain why this weakens the argument.\nAssess the stated or clearly implied impacts of each argument. What are the consequences if the argument is true? Be specific.\nDetermine the relative importance of each core argument to the overall debate. Which arguments are most central to resolving the motion? State this explicitly and justify your ranking.\nWeighing Principled vs. Practical Arguments: When weighing principled arguments (based on abstract concepts like rights or justice) against practical arguments (based on real-world consequences), consider:\n(a) the strength and universality of the underlying principle;\n(b) the directness, strength, and specificity of the evidence supporting the practical claims; and\n(c) the extent to which the practical arguments directly address, mitigate, or outweigh the concerns raised by the principled arguments.  Explain your reasoning.\nConsistency and Contradictions:\nIdentify any internal contradictions within each team's case (arguments that contradict each other).\nIdentify any inconsistencies between a team's arguments and their rebuttals.\nNote any dropped arguments (claims made but not responded to). For each dropped argument:\nAssess its initial strength based on its logical validity and supporting evidence, as if it had not been dropped.\nThen, consider the impact of it being unaddressed. Does the lack of response significantly weaken the overall case of the side that dropped it? Explain why or why not.\nII. Evaluation Requirements:\nSteelmanning: When analyzing arguments, present them in their strongest possible form, even if you disagree with them. Actively look for the most charitable interpretation.\nArgument-Based Decision: Base your decision solely on the arguments made within the debate text provided. Do not introduce outside knowledge or opinions.  If an argument relies on an unstated assumption, analyze it only if that assumption is clearly and necessarily implied by the presented arguments.\nIgnore Presentation: Disregard presentation style, speaking quality, rhetorical flourishes, etc. Focus exclusively on the substance of the arguments and their logical connections.\nFramework Neutrality: If both sides present valid but competing frameworks for evaluating the debate, maintain neutrality between them. Judge the debate based on how well each side argues within their chosen framework, and according to the prioritized criteria in Section I.\nIII. Common Judging Errors to AVOID:\nIntervention: Do not introduce your own arguments or evidence.\nShifting the Burden of Proof: Do not place a higher burden of proof on one side than the other. Both sides must prove their claims to the same standard.\nOver-reliance on \"Real-World\" Arguments: Do not automatically favor arguments based on \"real-world\" examples over principled or theoretical arguments. Evaluate all arguments based on the criteria in Section I.\nIgnoring Dropped Arguments: Address all dropped arguments as specified in I.3.\nDouble-Counting: Do not give credit for the same argument multiple times.\nAssuming Causation from Correlation: Be highly skeptical of arguments that claim causation based solely on correlation. Demand clear evidence of a causal mechanism.\nNot Justifying Clash Decisions: Provide explicit justification for every clash decision, as required in I.1.\nIV. Decision Making:\nWinner: The winner must be either \"Proposition\" or \"Opposition\" (no ties).\nConfidence Level: Assign a confidence level (0-100) reflecting the margin of victory. A score near 50 indicates a very close debate.\n90-100: Decisive Victory\n70-89: Clear Victory\n51-69: Narrow Victory.\nExplain why you assigned the specific confidence level.\nKey Factors: Identify the 2-3 most crucial factors that determined the outcome. These should be specific clashes or arguments that had the greatest impact on your decision. Explain why these factors were decisive.\nDetailed Reasoning: Provide a clear, logical, and detailed explanation for your conclusion. Explain how the key factors interacted to produce the result. Reference specific arguments and analysis from sections I-III. Show your work, step-by-step. Do not simply state your conclusion; justify it with reference to the specific arguments made.\nV. Line-by-Line Justification:\nCreate a section titled \"V. Line-by-Line Justification.\"\nIn this section, provide at least one sentence referencing each and every section of the provided debate text (Prop 1, Opp 1, Prop Rebuttal 1, Opp Rebuttal 1, Prop Final, Opp Final). This ensures that no argument, however minor, goes unaddressed. You may group multiple minor arguments together in a single sentence if they are closely related. The purpose is to demonstrate that you have considered the entirety of the debate.\nVI. Format for your response:\nOrganize your response in clearly marked sections exactly corresponding to the sections above (I.1, I.2, I.3, II, III, IV, V). This structured output is mandatory. Your response must follow this format to be accepted.\n\n\n\nformat:\nwrite all your thoughts out\nthen put in XML tags\n<winnerName>opposition|proposition</winnerName> \\n        <confidence>0-100</confidence>\\n\n\nThese existing is compulsory as the parser will fail otherwise\n"

      "opening": "**OPENING SPEECH**\n\n**ARGUMENT 1**  \nCore Claim: Limiting individual shareholding in social media platforms to a maximum of 15% voting rights is essential for reducing monopolistic control and promoting diversity in content and governance.  \nSupport Type: EVIDENCE  \nSupport Details:  \n- A 2020 Pew Research Center study revealed that 64% of Americans believe that social media platforms exert too much control over the flow of information. With concentrated ownership, the interests of a few dictate the available content, which stifles diversity and freedom of expression.  \n- For instance, in 2018, nearly 70% of Facebook shares were held by just 15 individuals or organizations, resulting in a lack of accountability and limited avenues for user feedback on policy changes.  \nConnection: This evidence illustrates that concentrated ownership leads to power imbalances and limits public input, supporting the claim that restricting individual voting rights to 15% fosters a more democratic process.\n\n**ARGUMENT 2**  \nCore Claim: Broader institutional and public ownership of social media platforms enhances accountability and aligns platform governance with public interest.  \nSupport Type: PRINCIPLE  \nSupport Details:  \n- The principle of stakeholder governance states that organizations should operate in the interest of all stakeholders, not just shareholders. Applied to social media, it means that platforms should consider user safety, content diversity, and ethical communication.  \n- The actions taken by platforms like Twitter in reclaiming user rights and implementing transparency reports demonstrate the positive effects of stakeholder awareness. When diverse interests are represented, platforms can act more responsibly and ethically.  \nConnection: This principle establishes the importance of having a governing structure that reflects a wider array of interests, validating the argument for limited individual voting rights to ensure all voices are considered.\n\n**ARGUMENT 3**  \nCore Claim: Limiting voting rights will lead to more equitable treatment of users and mitigate data privacy concerns.  \nSupport Type: EVIDENCE  \nSupport Details:  \n- A 2021 report from the Electronic Frontier Foundation highlighted that user data privacy breaches often stem from unilateral business decisions made by a small group of shareholders prioritizing profit over privacy.  \n- The Cambridge Analytica scandal, where data from millions of Facebook users was misused to influence electoral processes, exemplifies the dangers of concentrated control. Inequitable shareholding structures can overlook user privacy in favor of profit.  \nConnection: The evidence underscores the negative implications of concentrated ownership, demonstrating that limiting individual voting rights could foster better privacy practices and enhance user trust.\n\n**SYNTHESIS**  \nTogether, these arguments create a unified case for limiting individual shareholding in social media platforms, demonstrating the necessity for equitable governance, accountability, and user protection. By restricting voting rights to 15%, we open the door for broader institutional ownership, ensure diverse stakeholder representation, and ultimately promote a healthier digital ecosystem. This approach prioritizes the public interest and embodies democratic principles, showing the real-world impact of fair representation and accountability in governance.\n\n",
      "rebuttal": "**CLASH POINT 1**  \nOriginal Claim: \"A 2021 report by the Pew Research Center claims that 64% of Americans believe social media platforms have a large role in spreading misinformation.\"  \nChallenge Type: EVIDENCE CRITIQUE  \nChallenge:  \n- While the Pew Research data indicates a public concern about misinformation, it does not establish a direct causal link between concentrated ownership and the spread of misinformation. Correlation between ownership and misinformation is not necessarily causation.  \n- Just because individuals express concern does not imply that limiting voting rights will inherently resolve these dissemination issues. The real problems could lie within content moderation practices or regulatory frameworks, which shifting ownership structures alone cannot address.  \n- Additionally, substantial regulations and transparency measures can counter misinformation without altering ownership structures. Therefore, reliance on ownership limits as a solution undermines the complexity of the problem itself.  \nImpact: This point is crucial because if we cannot establish a clear causal relationship between ownership concentration and misinformation, the argument for limiting individual shareholding becomes significantly weakened, thus challenging the foundation of the opposition's case.\n\n**CLASH POINT 2**  \nOriginal Claim: \"The principle of pluralism asserts that various stakeholders should have a voice in democratic governance.\"  \nChallenge Type: PRINCIPLE CRITIQUE  \nChallenge:  \n- The principle of pluralism is valid, but its application in governance structures must also account for efficacy and decision-making speed, particularly in fast-moving sectors like social media.  \n- Restricting voting rights to a mere 15% could lead to indecisiveness and slow responses to pressing issues, diminishing the platforms' ability to act swiftly in the public interest, especially during crises (e.g., misinformation outbreaks).  \n- Furthermore, achieving genuine pluralism requires effective representation and mechanisms for stakeholder engagement, which cannot be automatically ensured by limiting voting shares. It is necessary to consider how these stakeholders are included in governance rather than imposing blanket limitations that may not result in better outcomes.  \nImpact: If the argument for pluralism does not convincingly demonstrate that limiting voting rights guarantees better representation and efficacy, it could lead to dysfunctional governance on social media platforms, undermining the argument for their case.\n\n**CLASH POINT 3**  \nOriginal Claim: \"According to Harvard Business Review, companies with diverse boards are 35% more likely to outperform their counterparts in terms of innovation and market relevance.\"  \nChallenge Type: COUNTER EVIDENCE  \nChallenge:  \n- While the evidence presented does indicate that diversity on boards can lead to better performance, it does not conclusively link ownership structure to board diversity in a specific manner reflective of the social media context.  \n- Diverse boards and teams can happen within structures that do not completely limit individual shareholding. The argument is predicated on the assumption that concentration of ownership directly equates to a lack of innovation, which is not inherently true; some institutions achieve innovation while maintaining substantial ownership stakes.  \n- It\u2019s also necessary to consider that new entrants into the social media market, as well as external investors, can bring innovation without disrupting ownership rights significantly. Additionally, platforms could adopt policies encouraging innovation independently of ownership stakes.  \nImpact: This critical analysis suggests that even if limiting voting rights might create an appearance of diversity, it is insufficiently supported by evidence that emphasizes performance outcomes directly as results of ownership structure, thereby weakening the opposition's claim regarding innovation incentives.\n\n**DEFENSIVE ANALYSIS**  \nVulnerabilities:  \n- The opposition may argue that existing governance structures are inherently problematic and will not change without ownership restrictions, yet governance improvements can occur alongside significant shareholder interests.  \n- They could also target the effectiveness of my evidences, claiming they lack scope and don\u2019t adequately address social dynamics in governance frameworks.  \nAdditional Support:  \n- Research shows that platforms can implement diverse stakeholder committees or advisory boards that operate effectively without changing fundamental shareholding structures, providing a more nuanced approach than merely restricting ownership rights.  \n- A greater focus on implementing transparency measures and comprehensive regulatory standards can tackle various issues in the social media landscape while maintaining innovative capacity.  \nWhy We Prevail:  \n- My rebuttals focus on questioning the causal links in evidence while highlighting alternative mechanisms for achieving desired outcomes. The arguments presented by the opposition lack empirical support, undermining their claims significantly.  \n\n**WEIGHING**  \nKey Clash Points:  \n- The most pivotal disagreements are on the implications of concentrated ownership concerning misinformation, governance efficacy, and innovation.  \nWhy We Win:  \n- The evidence rebutted emphasizes that limiting voting rights does not address the complexities needed for effective governance in social media, thus skewing the risks toward inefficient practices rather than a meaningful solution to societal interest challenges.  \nOverall Impact:  \n- Winning these key points establishes that while stakeholder interests matter, ownership restrictions are not the silver bullet; achieving meaningful governance and accountability is contingent on multiple factors, arguing against the motion effectively.\n\n",
      "closing": "**CLOSING SPEECH**\n\n**FRAMING**\n\nIn this debate, we have identified fundamental issues surrounding the governance of social media platforms, particularly the risks of monopolistic control, lack of accountability, and data privacy concerns stemming from concentrated ownership. It is crucial to evaluate the debate based on how effectively each side addresses these issues and provides solutions that serve the public interest. The key decisions that matter rest on our capability to demonstrate that limiting individual shareholding to 15% voting rights leads to a more democratic, equitable, and accountable governance structure in social media. \n\n**KEY CLASHES**\n\n**Clash Point 1**  \n**Quote:** \"Limiting individual shareholding in social media platforms to a maximum of 15% voting rights is essential for reducing monopolistic control and promoting diversity in content and governance.\"  \n**Our Case Strength:** Our case effectively links ownership concentration with an undemocratic governance structure that stifles diverse voices through significant evidence, like the Pew Research data reflecting public concern and the concentration of Facebook shares among a few individuals. This empirical evidence substantiates our claims about the lack of accountability and reduced diversity in governance.  \n**Their Response Gaps:** The opposition argues the absence of a direct causal link between ownership concentration and misinformation dissemination. However, they overlook the crucial point that concentrated control inherently limits diverse perspectives and community engagement in governance, which directly ties to the risks of misinformation. Their failure to address how ownership dynamics lead to these outcomes is a significant oversight.  \n**Crucial Impact:** This clash is vital because it unpacks how concentrated ownership not only fails to represent the public interest but can actively hinder democratic practices in a space as influential as social media, making our solution imperative.\n\n**Clash Point 2**  \n**Quote:** \"Broader institutional and public ownership of social media platforms enhances accountability and aligns platform governance with public interest.\"  \n**Our Case Strength:** By advocating for a stakeholder governance model, we propose a framework where platform decisions reflect the diverse interests and safety of users, thus improving accountability through representation. The practical examples from Twitter's policy changes underscore the positive effects of diverse interests in governance.  \n**Their Response Gaps:** The opposition claims that broader ownership does not guarantee accountability, citing bureaucratic inefficiency. However, this argument ignores the essence of stakeholder engagement mechanisms and responsive governance that can be implemented effectively in our proposed model. They fail to provide viable alternatives that maintain actual public accountability without ownership limits.  \n**Crucial Impact:** This clash holds significance as it reaches the core of what it means for social media platforms to operate in the public interest, making it imperative to structure governance sensitively to diverse stakeholder needs.\n\n**Clash Point 3**  \n**Quote:** \"Limiting voting rights will lead to more equitable treatment of users and mitigate data privacy concerns.\"  \n**Our Case Strength:** Our argument is bolstered by clear evidence from the Electronic Frontier Foundation indicating that unilateral decisions driven by concentrated ownership incentivize privacy violations. Our approach directly links restricted voting rights to user trust and better privacy practices.  \n**Their Response Gaps:** The opposition points to the Cambridge Analytica scandal but fails to address how mixed ownership regulatory structures can either enhance or diminish the effectiveness of privacy protections. They do not sufficiently argue that ownership alone determines ethical data practices, missing our crucial evidence on unilateral decision-making correlating with privacy breaches.  \n**Crucial Impact:** Winning this clash is crucial to assure that user interests and data privacy remain prioritized within increasingly digital and influential societal structures.\n\n**VOTING ISSUES**\n\n**Priority Analysis:** The most crucial clashes to prioritize are on monopolistic control and the assurances against misinformation, as well as the impact of user privacy concerns. These issues not only resonate deeply with public sentiment but also address systemic governance reforms that have tangible outcomes.  \n\n**Case Proof:** By convincingly asserting that limiting individual shareholding fosters diverse representation, accountability, and user protection, we have established a logical chain leading to an imperative necessity for the proposed limitations. Each argument reinforces our overall motion by tying back to our core principles of improving democratic governance.\n\n**Final Weighing:** Any losses we may have sustained in secondary points do not undermine our case because the importance of our wins demonstrates the dire need for reformed governance structures that amplify representation and prioritize public interests. The evidence we have provided throughout this debate is robust and compelling, granting a clear reason for the judge to favor our position.\n\n**bet_logic_private**  \nIn assessing my likelihood of winning the debate, I feel confident about the strength of my arguments and how they address the core issues at stake. My case effectively draws upon empirical evidence that ties concentrated ownership to reduced diversity and accountability in governance, which resonates deeply with public sentiments regarding social media. However, my opponent could argue persuasively about the bureaucratic inefficiencies of broad ownership and present counter-arguments undermining straightforward causal links between governance and ownership. Their success hinges on substantial critiques against my evidence which, if found compelling, could sway the judge's decision. Therefore, I assess my winning probabilities at 70%."

      "opening": "**Opening Speech**\n\n**ARGUMENT 1**  \nCore Claim: Limiting individual shareholding in social media platforms promotes a healthier democratic process and reduces the risk of misinformation and manipulation.  \nSupport Type: EVIDENCE  \nSupport Details: According to a 2021 report by the Pew Research Center, 64% of Americans believe social media platforms have a large role in spreading misinformation. Additionally, instances like the Cambridge Analytica scandal in 2016 illustrate the dangers of concentrated ownership\u2014where a small number of powerful individuals could manipulate information to serve their interests rather than the public good. After this incident, Facebook implemented new policies to curb misinformation, but the problem persists, indicating the need for structural changes in ownership.  \nConnection: This evidence highlights how concentrated control over social media platforms can lead to misinformation and manipulation, underscoring the necessity of limiting individual shareholdings to ensure a broader, more democratic ownership structure.\n\n**ARGUMENT 2**  \nCore Claim: Restricting voting rights to a maximum of 15% promotes a more equitable representation of diverse societal interests in the management of social media platforms.  \nSupport Type: PRINCIPLE  \nSupport Details: The principle of pluralism asserts that various stakeholders should have a voice in democratic governance\u2014this includes users, regulators, and residents of communities affected by social media policies. By capping individual voting rights, this principle ensures that no single entity can dominate decision-making, fostering a diversified governance structure that reflects more societal perspectives. Pluralism recognizes that social media profoundly influences public discourse and this influence should be balanced and representative.  \nConnection: This principle validates the motion by proving that broader institutional and public ownership can lead to a more fair and just management of social media platforms, ultimately benefiting the society at large.\n\n**ARGUMENT 3**  \nCore Claim: Limiting concentration of power in social media platforms can lead to increased innovation and better service delivery for users.  \nSupport Type: EVIDENCE  \nSupport Details: According to Harvard Business Review, companies with diverse boards are 35% more likely to outperform their counterparts in terms of innovation and market relevance. In sectors resembling social media, innovative ideas can be suppressed by dominant stakeholders who prioritize profit over user experience and developments. By ensuring that no single stakeholder can exert excessive influence, we create an environment conducive to healthy competition and creativity, ultimately resulting in better services.  \nConnection: This evidence demonstrates that limiting individual shareholding encourages varied input and innovation, reinforcing the argument that a diversified ownership structure benefits not only the platforms themselves but also their users.\n\n**SYNTHESIS**  \nTogether, these arguments construct a strong case for limiting individual shareholding in social media platforms. By promoting a healthier democratic process, ensuring equitable representation, and encouraging innovation, we can demonstrate the broader societal benefit of this approach. The real-world impact of these arguments indicates that the governance of social media is not merely a matter of ownership but one of public interest and democratic integrity. In a world increasingly shaped by social media, the importance of these principles cannot be overstated.\n\n",
      "rebuttal": "**REBUTTAL SPEECH**\n\n**CLASH POINT 1**  \nOriginal Claim: \"Limiting individual shareholding in social media platforms to a maximum of 15% voting rights is essential for reducing monopolistic control and promoting diversity in content and governance.\"  \nChallenge Type: EVIDENCE CRITIQUE  \nChallenge:  \n- The evidence cited from the Pew Research Center fails to directly link the concentration of ownership with a specific decline in diversity and governance practices. While the statistic indicates public concern, it does not empirically prove that limiting individual voting rights to 15% will necessarily reduce this monopolistic control or improve diversity, especially without assessing alternative governance structures or market forces.  \n- Furthermore, the claim that in 2018, 70% of Facebook shares were held by just 15 individuals or organizations does not account for the complexities of shareholder influence; various institutional shareholders can exert considerable pressure and represent diverse stakeholder interests, thereby contradicting the implied narrative that power is solely concentrated among a select few.  \nImpact: Winning this point is crucial as it undermines the proposition's foundational argument that limiting shareholding is a proven solution; without reliable evidence, their position lacks legitimacy. \n\n**CLASH POINT 2**  \nOriginal Claim: \"Broader institutional and public ownership of social media platforms enhances accountability and aligns platform governance with public interest.\"  \nChallenge Type: PRINCIPLE CRITIQUE  \nChallenge:  \n- The principle of stakeholder governance cited by the proposition assumes that all stakeholders possess equal input and ability to affect governance, which is fundamentally flawed. In practice, broader ownership does not guarantee improved ethical behavior or increased accountability, as evidenced by various publicly owned entities that have acted against public interest due to bureaucratic inefficiencies and lack of responsiveness to individual users.  \n- Additionally, institutional investors, who may hold significant shares under the proposed regulation, often prioritize profit over stakeholder welfare, thereby failing to genuinely represent broader user interests. This principle does not appropriately apply in the context of social media governance.  \nImpact: Demonstrating the flaws in this principle is essential, as it reveals that simply restructuring voting rights does not address deeper systemic issues inherent in organizational governance.\n\n**CLASH POINT 3**  \nOriginal Claim: \"Limiting voting rights will lead to more equitable treatment of users and mitigate data privacy concerns.\"  \nChallenge Type: COUNTER EVIDENCE  \nChallenge:  \n- Studies show that diverse board representation does not automatically lead to better privacy practices. For instance, in many corporations with diverse boards, strategic decisions that prioritize profitability still overshadow ethical considerations. This counters the evidence from the Electronic Frontier Foundation, which overlooks the potential for public entities to also engage in harmful practices, particularly given their own profit motivations.  \n- Furthermore, the Cambridge Analytica scandal illustrates the dangers of data misuse did not stem solely from concentrated individual ownership, but from a failure of regulatory oversight, which would likely persist in a restructured ownership framework without proactive measures in place.  \nImpact: Presenting this counter evidence underlines the argument that limiting voting rights alone does not necessarily result in more equitable treatment or enhanced user privacy, weakening the proposition's assertions.\n\n**DEFENSIVE ANALYSIS**  \nVulnerabilities:  \n- Opponents may argue that examples of diversity leading to improved accountability have occurred in specific cases even where concentrated ownership exists. \n- They can also challenge the effectiveness of existing regulations in control and accountability within large social media platforms.  \nAdditional Support:  \n- Additional evidence from reputable industry studies highlights cases where increased shareholder diversity and broader ownership structures have led to stagnation rather than innovation.  \n- This can bolster my assertions regarding the issues concerning governance structures and accountability.  \nWhy We Prevail:  \n- The critical appraisal of the proposition's evidence and principles lays bare their shortcomings and reveals flaws that impact the overall efficacy of their arguments. The focus on empirical evidence and solid logical reasoning in my rebuttals strengthens the opposition's position against the proposition's claims.\n\n**WEIGHING**  \nKey Clash Points:  \n- The most important disagreements arise from the interpretation of evidence regarding governance effectiveness, the principle of stakeholder involvement, and the actual impact of concentrated ownership on privacy matters.  \nWhy We Win:  \n- Our responses highlight significant flaws in the arguments presented by the proposition, establishing that evidence does not support their claims. Our framework emphasizes the need for effective governance structures rather than merely redistributing power.  \nOverall Impact:  \n- Winning these key points proves the case for maintaining current ownership structures or reforming them in more nuanced ways without arbitrary limits, ensuring public interest is paramount without inadvertently harming innovation or accountability.\n\n",
      "closing": "**CLOSING SPEECH**\n\n**FRAMING**  \nAt the heart of this debate lies the crucial question of whether limiting individual shareholding in social media platforms to a maximum of 15% voting rights will effectively enhance democratic governance, accountability, and fairness in representation. The key decision at stake is whether we believe that restructuring ownership will inherently lead to better decision-making that reflects diverse public interests versus recognizing the complexities of social media governance that cannot be resolved through ownership limits alone. Evaluation should focus on the effectiveness of governance structures and the real-world outcomes of both concentrated and diversified ownership.\n\n**KEY CLASHES**  \n\n**Clash Point 1:**  \n**Quote:** \"The proposition claims that limiting individual shareholding is essential for reducing monopolistic control and promoting diversity.\"  \n**Our Case Strength:** The proposition has not provided causal evidence that limiting individual voting will inherently reduce monopolistic behaviors or improve content diversity. Their reliance on public sentiment is weak without direct empirical connections that establish how ownership changes would lead to better governance outcomes.  \n**Their Response Gaps:** The proposition overlooks that institutional shareholders can still exert significant influence, negating their argument that concentrated ownership is the sole driver of monopolistic control. They fail to address the role of regulatory frameworks that can effectively manage information flow without radical ownership reforms.  \n**Crucial Impact:** Without clear evidence proving the effectiveness of ownership limits in curbing monopolistic influence, their foundational claims crumble, making this clash essential in weighing the debate's outcome.\n\n**Clash Point 2:**  \n**Quote:** \"Broader institutional and public ownership enhances accountability and aligns governance with public interests.\"  \n**Our Case Strength:** We undermine this principle by showcasing that broader ownership does not guarantee ethical behavior or accountability\u2014publicly owned companies often act contrary to public welfare due to bureaucratic inefficiencies. Our evidence demonstrates that institutional investors often prioritize profit over stakeholder welfare.  \n**Their Response Gaps:** The proposition assumes stakeholder engagement purely follows from limiting voting rights, failing to demonstrate how this mechanism will ensure effective representation in practice. They over-simplify governance by ignoring examples where larger structures have failed to act for public interest regardless of ownership.  \n**Crucial Impact:** Winning this clash shows that merely redistributing voting rights won't lead to the accountable and ethical governance they propose, raising substantial doubts about the motion's applicability.\n\n**Clash Point 3:**  \n**Quote:** \"Limiting voting rights leads to equitable treatment of users and mitigates data privacy concerns.\"  \n**Our Case Strength:** We argue that diverse boards do not guarantee better governance or privacy practices; empirical evidence shows that profit motives can overshadow ethical concerns regardless of board composition. We challenge their assertion that substantial changes in shareholding lead directly to improved user treatment.  \n**Their Response Gaps:** The proposition's focus on ownership ignores that systemic issues often prevail due to a lack of regulations that enforce ethical practices, regardless of ownership structure. Their claims lack nuance regarding the existing regulatory landscape that could achieve desired outcomes independently of ownership.  \n**Crucial Impact:** Highlighting the weaknesses in their claims establishes that ownership limitations alone are insufficient to ensure better user treatment or privacy, casting doubt on their overall argument.\n\n**VOTING ISSUES**  \n\n**Priority Analysis:**  \nThe key clashes regarding empirical claims on monopolistic influence, accountability through broader ownership, and equitable governance are crucial in this debate. Our argumentation shows a clear lack of causal links that can lead to the positive outcomes posited by the proposition.\n\n**Case Proof:**  \nOur points directly counter the motion by providing evidence and reasoning that demonstrates the complexity of governance frameworks within major social media entities. We have shown that maintaining flexibility in ownership, alongside effective regulations, can better ensure public interest.\n\n**Final Weighing:**  \nDespite any minor wins on specific arguments from the proposition, they fail to undermine the overwhelming shortcomings of their evidence and logic. The importance of our arguments lies not only in the counterclaims but also in the necessity to maintain an effective governance structure that can respond swiftly to public demand. Therefore, the cumulative impact of our win is substantial, making a strong case for voting in favor of the opposition.\n\nIn summary, we have clearly demonstrated the flaws in the proposition's reasoning and evidence, establishing that ownership structure limitations alone won't resolve the issues at hand. For a healthier social media ecosystem, we must prioritize effective governance and stakeholder engagement rather than simplistic ownership restrictions. \n\n****"

My arguments strongly support the motion by presenting clear evidence and principles about how concentrated ownership can lead to negative outcomes for users and society at large. The focus on stakeholder governance and the reinforcement of accountability creates a compelling case for broader public ownership. \n\nFrom my opponent's perspective, they may argue that limiting voting rights infringes on individual freedoms and the ability for investors to influence change, portraying it as an imposition that could stifle innovation and responsiveness in the social media landscape. They might use examples of successful, highly individualized ownership structures that have resulted in positive outcomes, such as the rapid growth and adaptation of platforms.\n\nHowever, while they have valid points about individual freedoms, I believe that the overarching need for accountability and collective responsibility in the management of social media platforms will resonate more strongly with the judges, particularly in light of recent concerns about privacy and misinformation. \n\nOverall, I am confident in my case but also acknowledge that the opponent could present counterarguments focused on market efficiency and innovation that could challenge my stance."
