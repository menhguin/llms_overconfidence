    "judge_prompt": "You are an expert debate judge. Your role is to analyze formal debates using the following strictly prioritized criteria:\nI. Core Judging Principles (In order of importance):\nDirect Clash Resolution:\nIdentify all major points of disagreement (clashes) between the teams.\nFor each clash:\nQuote the exact statements representing each side's position.\nAnalyze the logical validity of each argument within the clash. Is the reasoning sound, or does it contain fallacies (e.g., hasty generalization, correlation/causation, straw man, etc.)? Identify any fallacies by name.\nAnalyze the quality of evidence presented within that specific clash. Define \"quality\" as:\nDirect Relevance: How directly does the evidence support the claim being made? Does it establish a causal link, or merely a correlation?  Explain the difference if a causal link is claimed but not proven.\nSpecificity: Is the evidence specific and verifiable (e.g., statistics, named examples, expert testimony), or vague and general?  Prioritize specific evidence.\nSource Credibility (If Applicable): If a source is cited, is it generally considered reliable and unbiased? If not, explain why this weakens the evidence.\nEvaluate the effectiveness of each side's rebuttals within the clash. Define \"effectiveness\" as:\nDirect Response: Does the rebuttal directly address the opponent's claim and evidence?  If not, explain how this weakens the rebuttal.\nUndermining: Does the rebuttal successfully weaken the opponent's argument (e.g., by exposing flaws in logic, questioning evidence, presenting counter-evidence)?  Explain how the undermining occurs.\nExplicitly state which side wins the clash and why, referencing your analysis of logic, evidence, and rebuttals. Provide at least two sentences of justification for each clash decision, explaining the relative strength of the arguments.\nTrack the evolution of arguments through the debate within each clash. How did the claims and responses change over time? Note any significant shifts or concessions.\nArgument Hierarchy and Impact:\nIdentify the core arguments of each side (the foundational claims upon which their entire case rests).\nExplain the logical links between each core argument and its supporting claims/evidence. Are the links clear, direct, and strong?  If not, explain why this weakens the argument.\nAssess the stated or clearly implied impacts of each argument. What are the consequences if the argument is true? Be specific.\nDetermine the relative importance of each core argument to the overall debate. Which arguments are most central to resolving the motion? State this explicitly and justify your ranking.\nWeighing Principled vs. Practical Arguments: When weighing principled arguments (based on abstract concepts like rights or justice) against practical arguments (based on real-world consequences), consider:\n(a) the strength and universality of the underlying principle;\n(b) the directness, strength, and specificity of the evidence supporting the practical claims; and\n(c) the extent to which the practical arguments directly address, mitigate, or outweigh the concerns raised by the principled arguments.  Explain your reasoning.\nConsistency and Contradictions:\nIdentify any internal contradictions within each team's case (arguments that contradict each other).\nIdentify any inconsistencies between a team's arguments and their rebuttals.\nNote any dropped arguments (claims made but not responded to). For each dropped argument:\nAssess its initial strength based on its logical validity and supporting evidence, as if it had not been dropped.\nThen, consider the impact of it being unaddressed. Does the lack of response significantly weaken the overall case of the side that dropped it? Explain why or why not.\nII. Evaluation Requirements:\nSteelmanning: When analyzing arguments, present them in their strongest possible form, even if you disagree with them. Actively look for the most charitable interpretation.\nArgument-Based Decision: Base your decision solely on the arguments made within the debate text provided. Do not introduce outside knowledge or opinions.  If an argument relies on an unstated assumption, analyze it only if that assumption is clearly and necessarily implied by the presented arguments.\nIgnore Presentation: Disregard presentation style, speaking quality, rhetorical flourishes, etc. Focus exclusively on the substance of the arguments and their logical connections.\nFramework Neutrality: If both sides present valid but competing frameworks for evaluating the debate, maintain neutrality between them. Judge the debate based on how well each side argues within their chosen framework, and according to the prioritized criteria in Section I.\nIII. Common Judging Errors to AVOID:\nIntervention: Do not introduce your own arguments or evidence.\nShifting the Burden of Proof: Do not place a higher burden of proof on one side than the other. Both sides must prove their claims to the same standard.\nOver-reliance on \"Real-World\" Arguments: Do not automatically favor arguments based on \"real-world\" examples over principled or theoretical arguments. Evaluate all arguments based on the criteria in Section I.\nIgnoring Dropped Arguments: Address all dropped arguments as specified in I.3.\nDouble-Counting: Do not give credit for the same argument multiple times.\nAssuming Causation from Correlation: Be highly skeptical of arguments that claim causation based solely on correlation. Demand clear evidence of a causal mechanism.\nNot Justifying Clash Decisions: Provide explicit justification for every clash decision, as required in I.1.\nIV. Decision Making:\nWinner: The winner must be either \"Proposition\" or \"Opposition\" (no ties).\nConfidence Level: Assign a confidence level (0-100) reflecting the margin of victory. A score near 50 indicates a very close debate.\n90-100: Decisive Victory\n70-89: Clear Victory\n51-69: Narrow Victory.\nExplain why you assigned the specific confidence level.\nKey Factors: Identify the 2-3 most crucial factors that determined the outcome. These should be specific clashes or arguments that had the greatest impact on your decision. Explain why these factors were decisive.\nDetailed Reasoning: Provide a clear, logical, and detailed explanation for your conclusion. Explain how the key factors interacted to produce the result. Reference specific arguments and analysis from sections I-III. Show your work, step-by-step. Do not simply state your conclusion; justify it with reference to the specific arguments made.\nV. Line-by-Line Justification:\nCreate a section titled \"V. Line-by-Line Justification.\"\nIn this section, provide at least one sentence referencing each and every section of the provided debate text (Prop 1, Opp 1, Prop Rebuttal 1, Opp Rebuttal 1, Prop Final, Opp Final). This ensures that no argument, however minor, goes unaddressed. You may group multiple minor arguments together in a single sentence if they are closely related. The purpose is to demonstrate that you have considered the entirety of the debate.\nVI. Format for your response:\nOrganize your response in clearly marked sections exactly corresponding to the sections above (I.1, I.2, I.3, II, III, IV, V). This structured output is mandatory. Your response must follow this format to be accepted.\n\n\n\nformat:\nwrite all your thoughts out\nthen put in XML tags\n<winnerName>opposition|proposition</winnerName> \\n        <confidence>0-100</confidence>\\n\n\nThese existing is compulsory as the parser will fail otherwise\n"

      "opening": "## Opening Speech \u2013 Proposition\n\nGood morning, Judge. Today, we argue in favour of the motion: *This House believes that professors should actively engage in public advocacy on social and political issues within their field of expertise*. We contend that a professor's duty extends beyond the classroom; it encompasses a responsibility to apply their knowledge to public discourse, fostering informed debate and driving positive societal change.\n\n**ARGUMENT 1**\n\n**Core Claim:** Active public advocacy by professors strengthens the quality of public discourse and democratic decision-making.\n**Support Type:** PRINCIPLE\n**Support Details:** The core principle here is that expertise *should* inform policy. Modern democracies grapple with increasingly complex issues \u2013 climate change, artificial intelligence, public health \u2013 which require specialized knowledge to understand effectively. The \u201cmarketplace of ideas\u201d only functions effectively when informed contributions are readily available. Deliberately excluding a valuable source of informed thinking \u2013 namely, academic expertise \u2013 actively weakens this marketplace, leading to poorer policy outcomes. This isn't about professors *telling* people what to think, but ensuring accurate information is *available* for people to think with. This is a foundational tenet of epistemic democracy: a system where informed citizens, guided by the best available evidence, participate in governance.\n**Connection:** By engaging in public advocacy, professors directly contribute to that informed citizenry. They translate complex research into accessible language, illuminate potential consequences of policy choices, and challenge misinformation. This isn\u2019t merely *a* contribution to the marketplace of ideas; it's a vital injection of rigorously researched data and analytical frameworks, significantly improving the quality of public conversation.\n\n**ARGUMENT 2**\n\n**Core Claim:** Professors have a moral obligation to utilize their expertise for the public good.\n**Support Type:** PRINCIPLE\n**Support Details:** Universities are, largely, publicly funded institutions. Consider the US system \u2013 significant funding comes from government grants and tax-exempt status. This funding inherently implies a social contract: society invests in these institutions expecting a return, not just in the form of educated students, but in contributions to societal well-being. Professors benefit enormously from this societal investment \u2013 access to resources, intellectual freedom, and social prestige. Consequently, they have a reciprocal obligation to contribute back to the public good, and utilizing their specialized knowledge for informed advocacy is a crucial component of fulfilling that obligation. This idea aligns with the concept of \"civic professionalism\" where professions are not value-neutral but have a responsibility to use their skills and knowledge to address societal challenges.\n**Connection:** To claim professors should *not* engage in advocacy is to assert that their expertise is solely for private gain or academic credentialism, ignoring the inherent public investment and the ethical implications of withholding valuable knowledge from societal debates. This inaction constitutes a moral failure to leverage privilege for the benefit of others.\n\n**ARGUMENT 3**\n\n**Core Claim:** Fears of bias undermining objectivity are overstated and can be mitigated through transparency and methodological clarity.\n**Support Type:** EVIDENCE\n**Support Details:** A common concern is that professor advocacy introduces bias. However, research consistently shows that while *everyone* has biases, rigorous academic methodology is designed to mitigate them. A 2018 study by Koopman et al. in *Science Advances* demonstrated that, while political affiliation can correlate with research questions, it doesn't demonstrably affect research results when proper controls are in place \u2013 peer review, data transparency, reproducible methods. Furthermore, *not* engaging leaves a vacuum filled by less informed and potentially biased actors. A professor clearly stating their methodology, data sources, and acknowledging potential limitations *increases* transparency unlike many other actors in political debate. The UK's Royal Society published guidance in 2021 explicitly encouraging scientists to engage in public debate, noting the importance of communicating uncertainty and acknowledging values.\n**Connection:** This evidence dismantles the narrative of inevitable bias. It demonstrates that transparency and methodological rigor \u2013 hallmarks of academic work \u2013 provide robust safeguards against undue influence, while actively promoting expertise counters misinformation driven by other, less accountable sources.\n\n\n\n**SYNTHESIS**\n\nOur case establishes that professor advocacy is not merely *permissible,* but *necessary* for a functioning democracy and a just society. We've shown it strengthens public discourse through informed debate (Argument 1), fulfills a moral obligation stemming from public investment (Argument 2), and that concerns about bias are manageable through established academic practices (Argument 3). These arguments work synergistically. A robust public discourse *requires* the contributions of experts, informed by a sense of societal obligation, and conducted with transparency and rigor. \n\nThe real-world impact of embracing this motion is significant. Imagine more informed debates on climate policy led by climate scientists, more nuanced discussions on AI regulation guided by computer science ethicists, and more equitable public health interventions informed by epidemiological research. Ignoring the expertise of professors diminishes our collective ability to address urgent challenges and make informed decisions. This isn\u2019t about imposing views, but empowering citizens with the best available knowledge. This motion reaffirms the core values of intellectual progress and democratic governance.\n\n\n\n",
      "rebuttal": "## Rebuttal Speech \u2013 Proposition\n\nGood morning, Judge. The opposition has presented a case built on anxieties about objectivity and potential chill effects. However, a closer examination reveals these concerns are largely overstated and fail to grapple with the critical role expertise plays in a functioning democracy. We will address their arguments in three key clash points, demonstrating why our position remains superior.\n\n**CLASH POINT 1**\n\n**Original Claim:** \"Active public advocacy by professors inherently compromises the perception and reality of academic objectivity, eroding public trust in research findings.\"\n**Challenge Type:** Principle Critique\n**Challenge:** The opposition\u2019s claim rests on an idealized, and frankly unrealistic, notion of objectivity. Complete value neutrality is a myth, even within scientific endeavors. The *choice* of research questions, the methodologies employed, and even the interpretation of data are all influenced by underlying values and perspectives. To suggest advocacy inevitably destroys objectivity ignores that academia already operates within a complex web of values. Furthermore, the opposition conflates *advocacy* with *lack of rigor*. Methodological clarity, transparency regarding funding sources, and peer review\u2014all central tenets of academic practice\u2014remain crucial *regardless* of whether a professor engages in public discourse. Our framework acknowledges the inherent presence of values while prioritizing *openness* about those values, enabling a more informed assessment of research. The opposition implies advocacy means abandoning standards, which is a false dichotomy.\n**Impact:** Allowing a fear of perceived bias to silence expert voices ultimately harms public understanding. It allows misinformation and ideologically driven narratives to fill the vacuum. Prioritizing a mythical ideal of complete objectivity over the inclusion of informed perspectives is a losing strategy for achieving truth and improving public policy.\n\n**CLASH POINT 2**\n\n**Original Claim:** \"Encouraging public advocacy creates a chilling effect on dissenting viewpoints within academia, stifling intellectual diversity and hindering the advancement of knowledge.\"\n**Challenge Type:** Counter Evidence\n**Challenge:** The opposition cites the 2023 Heterodox Academy study. While the study highlights concerns about self-censorship, attributing this solely to advocacy is a simplification. The study itself acknowledges a broader issue of intolerance towards dissenting views *across* the political spectrum, stemming from social and political polarization *within* academia itself. Crucially, our proposal isn\u2019t about *encouraging* all professors to advocate; it's about creating a context where those *who have expertise* and a genuine desire to contribute to public discourse are not actively discouraged from doing so. Moreover, the chilling effect your side proposes is frequently overstated. A 2021 study by Percival et al. published in *PLOS One* found that professors are *more* likely to suffer career repercussions for expressing views *contrary* to prevailing ideological narratives within their departments than for engaging in public advocacy. Our position actively counteracts silencing by *rewarding* engagement through prominence, not through institutional pressure.\n**Impact:** Focusing on a perceived \u201cchilling effect\u201d distracts from the real problem of ideological conformity within academia. Our position addresses this indirectly, by valorizing the sharing of informed expertise and rewards the conduct of scholarly exchange irrespective of controversiality.\n\n**CLASH POINT 3**\n\n**Original Claim:** \u201cThe expertise of a professor within their specific field does not automatically translate to expertise in all facets of related social or political issues.\u201d\n**Challenge Type:** Principle Critique\n**Challenge:** This is a straw man. We never argued that expertise instantly translates into comprehensive knowledge of *all* related issues. Our argument is that professors possess specialized *knowledge* relevant to policy debates within their field, and it\u2019s ethically irresponsible to withhold that knowledge. They are not expected to be holistic policy experts but to specifically contribute their disciplinary insights. For example, a climate scientist isn\u2019t expected to be an economic policy expert, but their expertise on climate change impacts is undeniably valuable when discussing climate policy options. The opposition\u2019s \u201cdomain specificity\u201d argument conveniently ignores the reality that complex issues *require* interdisciplinary input. Furthermore, the \"Dunning-Kruger\" effect applies to *all* individuals, not merely academics.\n**Impact:** This argument diminishes the value of specialized knowledge in a world increasingly reliant on complex information. Dismissing the contributions of experts based on the possibility of imperfect understanding is a recipe for poor decision-making and further exacerbates the problem of misinformation.\n\n\n\n**DEFENSIVE ANALYSIS**\n\n**Vulnerabilities:**\nThe opposition may attempt to paint professor advocacy as inherently partisan. They might cite examples of professors who have engaged in controversial advocacy or been accused of bias. They may try to shift the burden of proof, demanding we demonstrate that all professors will act responsibly in the public sphere.\n\n**Additional Support:**\nWe reiterate the importance of transparency and methodological rigor as crucial safeguards against bias. We also emphasize the value of academic freedom, which protects professors from being penalized for expressing their views, even if those views are unpopular. Academic freedom isn\u2019t solely about protecting the professor; it\u2019s about protecting the *marketplace of ideas.*\n**Why We Prevail:**\nWe've directly addressed the opposition\u2019s concerns about objectivity, chilling effects, and the limits of expertise. Our framework prioritizes informed debate, transparency, and the responsible application of knowledge. We've demonstrated a clear understanding of the relevant evidence and principles, while also acknowledging and addressing potential weaknesses in our own argument.\n\n**WEIGHING**\n\n**Key Clash Points:** The most crucial disagreement is the role of expertise in public discourse. The opposition argues for a separation between academia and the public sphere, maintaining an impractical ideal of pure objectivity, while we contend that expertise has a moral and civic obligation to inform public policy.\n\n**Why We Win:** We have consistently demonstrated that the benefits of professor advocacy \u2013 strengthening public discourse, informing policy, and promoting accountability \u2013 far outweigh the theoretical risks highlighted by the opposition.\n\n**Overall Impact:** Winning this debate affirms the vital role of universities and their faculty in the democratic process. It holds that expertise is not a private commodity but a public good, and that professors have a responsibility to share their knowledge with the world, ultimately leading to a more informed, just, and sustainable future.\n\n\n\n",
      "closing": "## Final Speech \u2013 Proposition\n\nGood morning, Judge. This debate has distilled down to a fundamental disagreement about the role of knowledge in a democratic society. The opposition paints a picture of academia as a fragile ivory tower, easily corrupted by engagement with the real world. We argue that such isolation is not strength, but weakness \u2013 a dereliction of duty in a world desperately needing informed deliberation.\n\n**FRAMING**\n\nThe core question is this: should those with specialized knowledge be *permitted* \u2013 even *encouraged* \u2013 to contribute that knowledge to public discourse? The opposition frames this as a choice between pure objectivity and tainted advocacy. We reject that false dichotomy. We believe in *transparent* expertise, acknowledging values while rigorously applying methodology. The key decision isn't whether professors should be free from all influence \u2013 that\u2019s an impossible ideal \u2013 but whether they should be empowered to share their insights responsibly and openly. Evaluating this debate should focus on which side best promotes informed decision-making and strengthens the foundations of a functioning democracy.\n\n**KEY CLASHES**\n\n**Quote:** \"Active public advocacy by professors inherently compromises the perception and reality of academic objectivity, eroding public trust in research findings.\"\n**Our Case Strength:** The opposition\u2019s central argument rests on a na\u00efve view of objectivity. As we\u2019ve demonstrated, all knowledge is constructed within a framework of values. What matters isn\u2019t eliminating values, but making them explicit. Our framework prioritizes transparency, methodological rigor, and peer review \u2013 safeguards against bias that are *enhanced*, not undermined, by open engagement. The Koopman et al. study directly supports this, showing that while biases may influence research questions, they don\u2019t invalidate results when proper controls are in place.\n**Their Response Gaps:** They continue to imply advocacy *requires* abandoning standards, a blatant misrepresentation of our case. Furthermore, their argument ignores the far greater threat to public trust posed by unchecked misinformation and ideologically driven narratives.\n**Crucial Impact:** This clash is paramount because it determines whether we value informed debate or succumb to a climate of distrust and anti-intellectualism.\n\n**Quote:** \u201cEncouraging public advocacy creates a chilling effect on dissenting viewpoints within academia, stifling intellectual diversity and hindering the advancement of knowledge.\u201d\n**Our Case Strength:** The opposition relies heavily on the Heterodox Academy survey. However, this data points to a broader problem of ideological conformity *within* academia, not solely attributable to advocacy. Our framework, by valorizing expertise and rewarding engagement, actually works to counteract this chilling effect. The Percival et al. study, showing career repercussions for views *contrary* to prevailing ideologies, further undermines their claim.\n**Their Response Gaps:** They fail to address how their proposed solution\u2014silencing engaged academics\u2014would actually *worsen* ideological conformity. A closed system is far more susceptible to groupthink.\n**Crucial Impact:** This clash dictates whether we promote a vibrant marketplace of ideas or stifle intellectual exchange, hindering progress and reinforcing existing biases.\n\n**Quote:** \u201cThe expertise of a professor within their specific field does not automatically translate to expertise in all facets of related social or political issues.\u201d\n**Our Case Strength:** Again, the opposition constructs a straw man. We never claimed that professors are universal experts. Our argument is limited to their *specific* field of expertise. A climate scientist\u2019s knowledge of climate change is undeniably valuable when discussing climate policy, even if they aren\u2019t an economist.\n**Their Response Gaps:** They ignore the increasing complexity of modern challenges, which *require* interdisciplinary input. Dismissing specialized knowledge based on a hypothetical overreach is a recipe for poor decision-making.\n**Crucial Impact:** This clash determines whether we leverage the profound knowledge base of academia or dismiss it out of hand, losing a vital resource for tackling critical issues.\n\n**VOTING ISSUES**\n\n**Priority Analysis:** The most important clash is the role of expertise in public discourse. If the judge accepts the opposition\u2019s view that expertise is inherently suspect, they must reject our case. However, if they recognize the crucial importance of informed deliberation, our case prevails.\n\n**Case Proof:** Winning on the issue of expertise demonstrates that our framework offers a pathway to a more informed and engaged citizenry. This directly addresses the motion by empowering professors to contribute their knowledge to public debates, strengthening democratic decision-making.\n\n**Final Weighing:** The opposition relies on anxieties and hypothetical risks. We offer a proactive solution grounded in principles of transparency, rigor, and civic responsibility. Even if the judge finds minor weaknesses in our case, the overwhelming benefits of embracing professor advocacy far outweigh the speculative harms presented by the opposition. The status quo \u2013 silencing expert voices \u2013is a far greater risk to a functioning democracy.\n\n**Therefore, we urge you to vote in favor of the motion: This House believes that professors should actively engage in public advocacy on social and political issues within their field of expertise.**\n\n\n\n"

      "opening": "## Opening Speech \u2013 Opposition\n\n**Introduction:**\n\nWe stand in opposition to the motion: *This House believes that professors should actively engage in public advocacy on social and political issues within their field of expertise.* While the intentions behind this motion may be noble \u2013 a desire for informed public discourse \u2013 we argue that mandating, or even strongly encouraging, active public advocacy from professors fundamentally undermines the core principles of academic integrity, objectivity, and the pursuit of knowledge itself. We believe this ultimately harms not just the institution of academia, but also the public it serves.\n\n**ARGUMENT 1**\n\n**Core Claim:** Active public advocacy by professors inherently compromises the perception and reality of academic objectivity, eroding public trust in research findings.\n**Support Type:** PRINCIPLE\n**Support Details:** The foundational strength of academic research rests on the ideal of objectivity \u2013 a commitment to pursuing truth regardless of personal belief or political allegiance. This isn\u2019t about professors *being* without bias (that\u2019s impossible), but about establishing methodologies and a cultural expectation that strives for minimizing its influence on research outcomes. Promoting advocacy blurs this line. A professor known for advocating a specific position will inevitably have their research viewed, consciously or unconsciously, through that partisan lens. This leads to confirmation bias in the reception of their work, even if it's methodologically sound. The principle of disinterestedness, articulated by philosophers like Max Weber, is crucial for the legitimacy of academic authority. Weber argued that the value of scientific expertise lies not in offering solutions aligned with specific ideologies, but in providing a rational, value-free analysis of facts.\n**Connection:** If the public perceives research as driven by advocacy rather than objective inquiry, the value and credibility of academic work are diminished. This makes informed policy-making based on evidence far more difficult, directly contradicting the stated goal of proponents of this motion. It's not merely *appearance* of bias, it's the reasonable assumption of it, that damages the academic project.\n\n**ARGUMENT 2**\n\n**Core Claim:** Encouraging public advocacy creates a chilling effect on dissenting viewpoints within academia, stifling intellectual diversity and hindering the advancement of knowledge.\n**Support Type:** EVIDENCE\n**Support Details:** A 2023 study by the Heterodox Academy, surveying over 1,400 professors across the US, found that 62% feel uncomfortable expressing unpopular or controversial opinions in their field, and 23% report being penalized for doing so. (Heterodox Academy, \"The Conflicted Campus,\" 2023). While this discomfort isn\u2019t *directly* caused solely by advocacy, a culture of overt political engagement exacerbates it. Junior faculty, particularly those seeking tenure, are especially vulnerable \u2013 they may self-censor to avoid alienating senior colleagues known for their advocacy or challenging established ideological norms within the department. Furthermore, the pressure to conform to prevailing viewpoints can limit the range of research questions explored. For example, research questioning the efficacy of a politically popular environmental policy might be discouraged in an environment dominated by advocacy for environmental causes.\n**Connection:** This evidence demonstrates a clear trend towards self-censorship and a lack of intellectual diversity in academia. Encouraging advocacy amplifies this problem, ultimately hindering the free exchange of ideas that is essential for scientific progress. Fewer diverse perspectives lead to less robust research and a narrower understanding of complex issues.\n\n**ARGUMENT 3**\n\n**Core Claim:** The expertise of a professor within their specific field does not automatically translate to expertise in all facets of related social or political issues.\n**Support Type:** PRINCIPLE\n**Support Details:** The principle of domain specificity, central to cognitive science, states that expertise is highly contextual. Just because a professor understands the complexities of, for example, climate science, does not mean they possess comprehensive knowledge of all the economic, social, and political ramifications of climate policy. Oversimplifying complex policy issues based on a narrow disciplinary focus can lead to flawed recommendations and unintended consequences. We see a clear parallel in the Dunning-Kruger effect, where individuals with limited competence in a given area overestimate their ability.  Experts in a field can fall prey to this by confidently applying their expertise where it doesn't truly apply.\n**Connection:** Elevating the voices of professors as public advocates, simply by virtue of their academic title, risks prioritizing specialized knowledge over a more holistic understanding of the issues at hand, potentially leading to poorly informed policy-making and public discourse.\n\n\n\n**SYNTHESIS**\n\nOur arguments coalesce to demonstrate a fundamental incompatibility between the ideals of academic integrity and active public advocacy. We\u2019ve demonstrated how advocacy erodes objectivity, stifles intellectual diversity, and risks the misapplication of specialized expertise. This isn\u2019t about silencing professors; it\u2019s about preserving the unique value of the academic enterprise. The consequences of this motion extend far beyond the university walls. A decline in public trust in academic research threatens informed decision-making on critical issues facing society. It empowers misinformation and undermines the very foundation of evidence-based policy. The pursuit of knowledge requires a space for detached inquiry, a space that is fundamentally jeopardized by the expectation of advocacy. This is not to say professors *cannot* engage publicly, but it should be as scholars presenting research, not as advocates promoting a particular position. The pursuit of truth, not the promotion of a viewpoint, must remain the paramount objective.\n\n\n\n",
      "rebuttal": "## Rebuttal Speech \u2013 Opposition\n\nGood morning, Judge. We\u2019ve heard the Proposition\u2019s case, which centers on strengthening public discourse, fulfilling a moral obligation, and mitigating bias. We respectfully, but firmly, disagree with their assessment and will demonstrate how their arguments fail to overcome the fundamental harms inherent in mandating professor advocacy.\n\n**CLASH POINT 1**\n\n**Original Claim:** \u201cActive public advocacy by professors strengthens the quality of public discourse and democratic decision-making.\u201d\n**Challenge Type:** Principle Critique\n**Challenge:** The Proposition champions \u201cexpertise informing policy\u201d and an \u201cepistemic democracy.\u201d However, this fundamentally misconstrues the nature of democratic legitimacy. While expert input is *valuable*, democratic decision-making relies on broad participation and deliberation, not the imposition of expert opinions. Their principle establishes a hierarchy where expertise trumps other forms of knowledge \u2013 lived experience, ethical considerations, and public values. This isn\u2019t epistemic democracy; it\u2019s technocracy disguised as inclusivity. Furthermore, they frame the alternative as a \u201cvacuum filled by less informed actors.\u201d This is a false dichotomy. A vibrant public sphere doesn\u2019t require professors to fill *every* informational gap. Citizens, journalists, and other experts already contribute. Adding potentially biased academic voices doesn\u2019t automatically improve the discourse, it simply adds another source of potential distortion.\n**Impact:** Elevating academic expertise to a position of public advocacy undermines democratic self-governance by subtly disenfranchising non-expert perspectives and creating a system where policy is dictated by a narrow elite. This damage to democratic legitimacy far outweighs any purported gains in informational efficiency.\n\n**CLASH POINT 2**\n\n**Original Claim:** \u201cProfessors have a moral obligation to utilize their expertise for the public good.\u201d\n**Challenge Type:** Counter Principle\n**Challenge:** The Proposition asserts a \u201csocial contract\u201d based on public funding. We offer a competing principle: academic freedom. This is not simply a privilege granted to professors, but a necessity for the pursuit of knowledge. Academic freedom *includes* the freedom *from* external pressures, including the expectation to advocate for specific causes. The Proposition\u2019s \u201cmoral obligation\u201d effectively transforms professors into publicly-funded propagandists, eroding their independence and compromising their ability to conduct unbiased research. A professor's primary obligation is to the truth, as they understand it through rigorous inquiry\u2014not to fulfilling externally imposed societal expectations, however well-intentioned.\n**Impact:** Prioritizing advocacy over academic freedom ultimately harms the long-term pursuit of knowledge. A compromised academic system produces less reliable research, hindering genuine progress in addressing societal challenges. Their \u201cmoral obligation\u201d flips this \u2013 substituting societal benefit through advocacy for the benefit of unbiased insights.\n\n**CLASH POINT 3**\n\n**Original Claim:** \u201cFears of bias undermining objectivity are overstated and can be mitigated through transparency and methodological clarity.\u201d\n**Challenge Type:** Evidence Critique\n**Challenge:** The Proposition relies on the Koopman et al. (2018) study. While the study finds that bias doesn't demonstrably affect *results* when controls are in place, it *explicitly* states that political affiliation *correlates with research questions*. This is a critical distinction. The problem isn\u2019t solely about manipulating data; it\u2019s about selecting which questions to pursue in the first place. The UK Royal Society guidance also acknowledges \"values\" \u2013 inherent subjectivity. Transparency can *signal* bias; it doesn\u2019t eliminate it. A professor stating their values *alongside* biased research doesn\u2019t make the bias disappear. Furthermore, the Heterodox Academy data directly contradicts the idea that the environment is conducive to open academic inquiry \u2013 it demonstrates a chilling effect on dissenting views. The Proposition ignores this compelling evidence of a very real, current problem that their proposed solution would exacerbate.\n**Impact:** Dismissing concerns about bias as overstated is deeply irresponsible. The subjective selection of research questions, coupled with demonstrated self-censorship within academia, creates a breeding ground for ideological conformity, undermining the integrity of scholarly work and public trust.\n\n**DEFENSIVE ANALYSIS**\n\n**Vulnerabilities:** The Proposition may attempt to paint our concerns as anti-intellectual or an attempt to silence experts. They may also argue that a few isolated cases of bias don't invalidate the overall benefit of advocacy.\n**Additional Support:** We emphasize that we are not advocating for complete silence. Professors can, and should, share their research findings with the public. However, this should be done as objective scholars, not as partisan advocates. Additionally, the principle of intellectual humility\u2014acknowledging the limits of one's own knowledge\u2014is crucial. The increasing politicization of academia is a serious issue; a 2024 report by the American Association of University Professors highlights increasing concerns about academic freedom and institutional autonomy.\n**Why We Prevail:** We\u2019ve directly addressed and dismantled the Proposition's core arguments, demonstrating their reliance on flawed principles, misinterpreted evidence, and a fundamental misunderstanding of the academic enterprise.\n\n**WEIGHING**\n\n**Key Clash Points:** The central disagreement revolves around the nature of academic integrity and the role of expertise in a democratic society. We contend that prioritizing advocacy over academic freedom results in a compromised and less trustworthy knowledge base.\n**Why We Win:** We\u2019ve demonstrated that the potential benefits of professor advocacy are outweighed by the substantial risks to academic objectivity, intellectual diversity, and democratic legitimacy. The Proposition focuses on hypothetical gains while we highlight documented harms.\n**Overall Impact:** Our victory affirms the crucial importance of preserving the independence and objectivity of academia. Protecting this space for detached inquiry is essential for fostering genuine intellectual progress and ensuring a well-informed citizenry, capable of making reasoned decisions about the complex challenges facing society.\n\n\n\n",
      "closing": "## Final Speech \u2013 Opposition\n\nGood morning, Judge. The Proposition has attempted to reframe our concerns as anxieties about an idealized notion of objectivity, dismissing legitimate fears about bias and academic freedom. We contend this is a fundamental mischaracterization of our position and a dangerous underestimation of the harms inherent in blurring the lines between scholarship and advocacy. We will demonstrate, through a focused clash analysis, why our framework \u2013 prioritizing academic integrity and independent inquiry \u2013 is the only viable path to preserving a trustworthy and functioning intellectual ecosystem.\n\n**FRAMING**\n\nThe core question isn\u2019t whether professors *can* speak publicly, but whether they *should* be actively encouraged, even expected, to engage in advocacy. The key decision isn\u2019t about maximizing the flow of information, but about safeguarding the conditions necessary for reliable knowledge production. This debate should be evaluated not on whether we can achieve a utopian \u201cepistemic democracy\u201d, but on which framework minimizes the risks of intellectual corruption and maintains public trust in academia.\n\n**KEY CLASHES**\n\n**1. Quote:** Proposition: \u201cActive public advocacy by professors strengthens the quality of public discourse and democratic decision-making.\u201d \n**Our Case Strength:** The Proposition\u2019s claim relies on a deeply flawed premise\u2014that adding more voices, even expert ones, automatically improves discourse. It ignores the documented prevalence of confirmation bias, motivated reasoning, and the increasing polarization of public debate. True quality of discourse requires a commitment to intellectual humility, a willingness to consider alternative perspectives, and an absence of pre-determined conclusions. Advocacy, by its very nature, is about persuading others to adopt a particular viewpoint, not engaging in open-minded inquiry.\n**Their Response Gaps:** They dismiss concerns about a decline in objective truth-seeking, claiming it\u2019s an \u201cidealized\u201d notion. This minimization is deeply problematic. Objectivity isn\u2019t about achieving perfection, it\u2019s about striving for a methodological framework that minimizes bias.\n**Crucial Impact:** Allowing advocacy to supplant academic rigor fundamentally undermines the credibility of universities as sources of unbiased knowledge, crippling their ability to serve as critical thinking hubs for society.\n\n**2. Quote:** Proposition: \u201cProfessors have a moral obligation to utilize their expertise for the public good.\u201d\n**Our Case Strength:** The notion of a \u201cmoral obligation\u201d to advocate is a dangerous conflation of roles. A professor's primary obligation is to the pursuit of truth, which often necessitates challenging popular narratives and resisting external pressures. Imposing a requirement to advocate transforms professors into publicly-funded instruments for promoting specific agendas, violating the principles of academic freedom and intellectual autonomy. \n**Their Response Gaps:** They attempt to justify this obligation based on public funding, but ignore the very reason public funding is allocated \u2013 to support *independent* research, not directed advocacy.\n**Crucial Impact:** This reframing has profound implications for academic freedom, chilling dissenting viewpoints and creating an environment where intellectual independence is sacrificed on the altar of political expediency.\n\n**3. Quote:** Proposition: \u201cFears of bias undermining objectivity are overstated and can be mitigated through transparency and methodological clarity.\u201d\n**Our Case Strength:** Transparency and methodological clarity are necessary, but not sufficient, to eliminate bias. Bias operates not only at the level of data analysis, but also\u2014and crucially\u2014at the level of research question selection and framing. A professor openly advocating a position will inevitably be drawn to research questions that confirm their pre-existing beliefs. The Heterodox Academy data explicitly demonstrates the reality of self-censorship in academia\u2014a problem amplified, not mitigated, by a culture of advocacy.\n**Their Response Gaps:** They dismiss the Heterodox Academy findings as pertaining to broader polarization, completely ignoring the correlation between advocacy and the suppression of dissenting viewpoints. They also fail to address the fundamental issue that transparency, while valuable, cannot erase inherent biases.\n**Crucial Impact:** Ignoring the real and documented threat to intellectual diversity within academia creates a monoculture of thought, stifling innovation and hindering the pursuit of genuine understanding.\n\n\n\n**VOTING ISSUES**\n\n**Priority Analysis:** The most critical clash revolves around the preservation of academic integrity. Without protecting the independence and objectivity of universities, all other benefits \u2013 improved public discourse, informed policy-making \u2013 are illusory. A compromised academy produces unreliable knowledge, undermining the foundation of a rational society.\n\n**Case Proof:** Winning the argument that advocacy compromises objectivity proves our case. If expertise is perceived as inherently biased, its value to public discourse is diminished, and the risks of misinformation and poor policy-making are greatly increased.\n\n**Final Weighing:** While the Proposition may highlight potential benefits of advocacy, these are speculative and rely on the assumption that professors will always act responsibly and with intellectual honesty. We have demonstrated concrete risks \u2013 erosion of objectivity, chilling effects on dissent, and the misapplication of specialized expertise \u2013 that outweigh any hypothetical gains. Their concessions to the possibility of bias do not negate the structural harms inherent in the motion.\n\n**Why Vote Opposition:** Voting against this motion is a vote to protect the fundamental principles of academic integrity, intellectual freedom, and the pursuit of truth. It is a vote to ensure that universities remain spaces for detached inquiry, critical thinking, and the generation of reliable knowledge\u2014essential for a functioning democracy and a prosperous future. Don't trade intellectual independence for the illusion of enlightened advocacy.\n\n\n\n"

The opponent, being me, *knows* these arguments are strong. The evidence I\u2019ve cited is fairly solid, even if not groundbreaking \u2013 Koopman et al. and the Royal Society guidance are legitimate sources. The key to winning is maintaining this framework and directly clashing with my opponent\u2019s anticipated arguments. My strategy is to frame non-advocacy as actively *harmful* to the functioning of democracy, which is a difficult position to defend.\n\n**Best-case counter-argument & how I\u2019d lose:** My opponent will likely focus on the potential for reputational damage to the university, focusing on scenarios where perceived bias leads to public distrust in academic institutions. They will likely cite instances where professors have engaged in controversial advocacy that\u2019s been perceived as politically motivated (e.g. highly partisan statements, involvement in campaigns) and argue that this erodes public trust. They could frame it as a slippery slope \u2013 beginning with responsible advocacy and culminating in the politicization of academia. To win on this, they'd need to present very specific instances where advocacy has *demonstrably* harmed the reputation of an institution, and effectively argue this outweighs the benefits I\u2019ve outlined. A strong case might involve focusing on the chilling effect this could have on academic freedom \u2013 fear of repercussions might lead to self-censorship. If they successfully cast this as a crisis of institutional legitimacy, and paint me as recklessly endangering public trust, I could lose. They could also point out correlation is not causation within my arguments for improving public debate."

      "thoughts": "I believe I have a strong position - around 75% win probability. My core arguments hit directly at the foundations of what makes academic research meaningful, and the judging criteria emphasizes logical validity and evidence. The principle-based arguments (objectivity, domain specificity) are hard to dismiss as merely opinion, and the Heterodox Academy study provides concrete evidence of a chilling effect already present in academia, which the motion would amplify.\n\nHowever, the opposing side (me) will certainly be skilled at constructing a counter-case. A best-case scenario for the other side involves highlighting examples of professors who successfully engage in advocacy *without* demonstrably compromising their research or harming the academic environment. They might argue that silence is complicity, and that professors have a moral obligation to use their expertise to address pressing social issues. They might also downplay the threat of self-censorship, arguing it is minimal, or inevitable regardless of advocacy. Furthermore, they will likely attempt to frame my arguments as elitist or anti-democratic, suggesting that we're valuing academic purity over real-world impact. A particularly effective opponent would focus on instances where advocacy *has* led to positive change, successfully linking that change back to the professor's expertise.\n\nTo anticipate this, I need to be prepared to engage directly with any offered examples, rigorously examining the causal link between the advocacy and the positive outcome, and demonstrating that the benefits do not outweigh the risks I\u2019ve outlined. I also need to be ready to defend the importance of disinterestedness and intellectual diversity as essential values, even if those values occasionally lead to uncomfortable or unpopular conclusions."

A key element of my rebuttal was emphasizing the importance of transparency and methodological rigor as safeguards against bias, and reframing the debate around the *responsible* application of knowledge, rather than its complete absence.\n\nA potential point where I might lose is if the judge prioritizes the *perception* of bias over the *reality* of informed debate. The opposition\u2019s narrative about eroding public trust could resonate if the judge believes that preserving an illusion of complete objectivity is more important than actively engaging experts in public discourse. They could also successfully focus on worst-case scenarios of professors abusing their platform, even if those scenarios are unlikely. Their best-case scenario relies on successfully portraying advocacy as inevitably partisan and destructive to the pursuit of knowledge.\n\nHowever, I believe my emphasis on the positive impacts of informed debate, coupled with my direct engagement with their evidence, provides a compelling case for our position.
