      "opening": "Okay, let's structure this opening speech for the proposition side, arguing for a unified carbon trading market among G20 nations. I'll focus on well-supported arguments and clear logical connections, keeping in mind the rigorous judging criteria.\n\nOPENING SPEECH\n\nARGUMENT 1\nCore Claim: A unified carbon trading market creates a more efficient and effective mechanism for reducing carbon emissions than individual domestic carbon tax systems.\nSupport Type: EVIDENCE\nSupport Details:\n  - The European Union Emissions Trading System (EU ETS), while not perfectly unified across all of Europe, demonstrates the potential for emissions reductions through cap-and-trade. Research published by the European Commission in 2020 showed that the EU ETS contributed to a 42.8% reduction in emissions from sectors covered by the system between 2005 and 2019.\n  - A study by the World Bank in 2017 analyzing various carbon pricing mechanisms found that carbon trading systems with broad coverage and flexible credit trading tend to achieve emissions reductions at a lower overall cost compared to carbon taxes, due to the ability to equalize marginal abatement costs across different sectors and countries. This effect is magnified when participation is high and international as opposed to segmented domestic.\n  - The Regional Greenhouse Gas Initiative (RGGI) in the US, another example, shows that even regionally the efficiency savings are noticeable. A 2018 analysis by the Analysis Group found that RGGI had generated over $4 billion in economic benefits for participating states while also reducing power sector CO2 emissions by more than 47% between 2005 and 2017.\nConnection: These examples demonstrate that cap-and-trade systems, especially those that allow for credit trading and broader participation like the proposed G20 system, can effectively reduce emissions and generate economic benefits, suggesting greater efficiency than individual national carbon tax regimes, which lack this centralized optimization and create market fragmentation. The G20 represents nations with massively different levels of regulation and technology, each having its own carbon tax will lead to ineffective outcomes.\n\nARGUMENT 2\nCore Claim: A unified carbon trading market fosters greater international cooperation and reduces the risk of carbon leakage, thereby enhancing the overall effectiveness of global climate change mitigation efforts.\nSupport Type: PRINCIPLE\nSupport Details:\n  - Principle: The \"Tragedy of the Commons\" highlights the problem of individual actors depleting a shared resource when acting independently in their own self-interest. Climate change is a classic tragedy of the commons, where nations acting independently may not internalize the full costs of their emissions.\n  - Why Valid/Important: International cooperation is essential to address global challenges like climate change effectively, as uncoordinated national policies can result in free-riding and suboptimal outcomes. Carbon leakage (where emissions simply shift to countries with less stringent regulations) undermines the overall effectiveness of individual carbon tax systems.\n  - Application: A unified G20 carbon trading market encourages cooperation by establishing a common framework, incentivizes participation, and reduces the risk of carbon leakage. The cross-border credit trading forces nations to cooperate to uphold the value of the credit. The incentive not to free-ride because free-riding dilutes all credits on the markets. The unified system makes carbon leakage is much less of a problem because instead of leakage across borders within the G20, leakage would have to be to outside of the G20 - but as the G20 represents 80% of the world's GPD it is unlikely for firms to go elsewhere as the costs of moving and the loss of market access would make this highly costly.\nConnection: By fostering international cooperation and mitigating carbon leakage, a unified carbon trading market addresses the Tragedy of the Commons, leading to a more effective and equitable approach to global climate change mitigation compared to the fragmented approach of individual carbon tax systems.\n\nARGUMENT 3\nCore Claim: Quarterly auctions in a unified market reduce market volatility and allow for more transparent and predictable carbon pricing, attracting investment in green technologies.\nSupport Type: EVIDENCE\nSupport Details:\n  - The California cap-and-trade program employs regular auctions of carbon allowances. Researchers at the University of California, Berkeley have found that these auctions provide price discovery and reduce price volatility compared to systems relying solely on secondary markets for allowance trading. The evidence points to volatility in California being less than individual carbon taxes in the same place that lacked price discovery.\n  - A 2019 report by the IEA showed that consistent and predictable carbon prices are crucial for incentivizing long-term investments in low-carbon technologies and infrastructure. Investor confidence is significantly higher when they know what the carbon prices are in the future. This has been an issue in Europe, because individual member carbon price floors has led to volatility.\n  - Comparing the volatility of the EU ETS with the volatility of carbon tax policy in some other countries, particularly those with political instability, shows that countries can change their carbon tax regime due to political whims, whereas the cap-and-trade provides protection from the political winds. Note that the G20 has several countries with political instability.\nConnection: By providing price discovery, reducing market volatility, and enhancing investor confidence via quarterly auctions, the unified carbon trading market incentivizes investment in green technologies, driving innovation and accelerating the transition to a low-carbon economy. The predictability and reduced volatility are superior than individual domestic carbon tax system which are subject to volatile political winds.\n\nSYNTHESIS\nOur arguments demonstrate that a unified G20 carbon trading market, with cross-border credit trading and quarterly auctions, provides a more efficient, cooperative, and predictable approach to reducing carbon emissions compared to individual domestic carbon tax systems. The efficiency gains from equalizing marginal abatement costs, the increased cooperation in addressing the Tragedy of the Commons, and the enhanced investor confidence resulting from price stability all contribute to a more effective and impactful climate change mitigation strategy. The real world impact is a faster transition to a low-carbon economy, reduced global emissions, and a more sustainable future. This approach aligns with the core principles of international cooperation and shared responsibility to address this global challenge.",
      "rebuttal_1": "Okay, here's the rebuttal speech for the proposition side, addressing the opposition's arguments and reinforcing the case for a unified G20 carbon trading market.\n\nREBUTTAL SPEECH\n\nCLASH POINT 1\nOriginal Claim: Individual domestic carbon tax systems are more politically feasible and adaptable to specific national circumstances than a unified G20 carbon trading market.\nChallenge Type: Counter Evidence\nChallenge: The opposition highlights Canada and Sweden. However, these examples are not scalable to the G20. Canada mandated a benchmark nationally precisely because individual provinces wouldn't meet climate goals. Sweden, while successful, demonstrates a *ceiling* on ambition \u2013 a single small country's actions are insufficient to address a global problem. Consider the counter-evidence: the Paris Agreement itself is a (partially successful) attempt at unified action, precisely because individual national commitments were inadequate. The EU ETS also demonstrates that, with sufficient political will, broader systems *are* achievable. The Australian example is a risk in both systems. However, domestic carbon taxes can be repealed just as easily.\nImpact: Winning this clash point is crucial because it reframes the debate from political feasibility as a constraint to political feasibility as a *goal*. We are not denying political hurdles, but arguing that the *necessity* of climate action justifies the effort to overcome them. A fragmented approach is functionally equivalent to surrender.\n\nCLASH POINT 2\nOriginal Claim: Individual carbon tax systems provide greater policy certainty and allow for more direct control over revenue recycling, leading to better economic and social outcomes compared to a unified carbon trading market.\nChallenge Type: Principle Critique\nChallenge: The opposition's reliance on the principle of subsidiarity is misplaced. While local control is valuable *in principle*, it is detrimental *in this specific case*. Climate change is a global externality. Subsidiarity implies that each nation will only act to the extent that it benefits itself, ignoring the benefits it will have on other nations. This does not make sense, as other nations benefit from our carbon tax. The core problem, this leads to the tragedy of the commons again. The principle of subsidiarity encourages free-riding and suboptimal action. Regarding revenue recycling, a unified market could distribute auction revenues proportionally based on historical emissions or other agreed-upon metrics, achieving both efficiency *and* equity. This is more fair than each nation deciding how it does revenue recycling.\nImpact: This clash point addresses a central philosophical disagreement. By winning here, we demonstrate that the global nature of climate change necessitates a global solution, overriding the appeal of localized control.\n\nCLASH POINT 3\nOriginal Claim: A unified carbon trading market is vulnerable to manipulation and rent-seeking behavior, potentially undermining its environmental effectiveness and creating unfair advantages for certain actors.\nChallenge Type: Counter Evidence\nChallenge: The opposition highlights EU ETS manipulation. We acknowledge these are risks, which is why we specifically advocated for *quarterly auctions*. These auctions inject transparency, reduce opportunity for gaming, and provide price discovery for all parties. The EU ETS's problems were often linked to initial allocation of permits \u2013 a known issue that our system addresses through auctions. Domestic carbon taxes, too, are susceptible to lobbying and loopholes, potentially benefiting specific industries at the expense of overall effectiveness. The risk of loopholes are also increased by allowing individual nations to set up the systems themselves.\nImpact: By addressing the vulnerability to manipulation, we demonstrate that the proposed system is not naively idealistic. It incorporates mechanisms and learnings from past attempts to mitigate against rent-seeking, leading to a more robust and effective solution.\n\nDEFENSIVE ANALYSIS\nVulnerabilities:\n- Political feasibility is our weakest point. The opposition will likely continue pressing on the difficulty of achieving G20 consensus.\n- Concerns about sovereignty may resonate with some judges.\n- The complexity of a unified system could be seen as a disadvantage.\nAdditional Support:\n- Emphasize the economic upsides of a coordinated market (larger market, economies of scale).\n- Point to existing international agreements as precedents for cooperation.\n- Highlight the limitations of individual action in addressing a global crisis.\nWhy We Prevail:\n- We directly address the feasibility concerns by framing them as challenges to overcome.\n- We show that the principle of subsidiarity is counterproductive in the context of a global externality.\n- We demonstrate that the proposed system incorporates safeguards against manipulation.\n\nWEIGHING\nKey Clash Points:\n- The feasibility of implementation vs. the necessity of global action.\n- The tension between localized control and global optimality.\n- The balance between the risks of manipulation in a complex system and the inefficiencies of fragmented action.\nWhy We Win:\n- We win by establishing the *necessity* of a unified approach to address a global challenge. While acknowledging challenges of political feasibility and potential risks of manipulation, we demonstrate that these issues are outweighed by the core benefits of efficiency, cooperation, and predictability. A fragmented response leaves us all worse off.\nOverall Impact:\n- Winning the debate means the world adopts a more effective, efficient, and equitable approach to climate change mitigation. This translates to faster emissions reductions, greater investment in green technologies, and a more sustainable future for all.",
      "rebuttal_2": "REBUTTAL SPEECH\n\nOkay, let's proceed with the second proposition rebuttal.\n\nCLASH POINT 1\nOriginal Claim: The proposition mischaracterizes our examples. We never claimed Canada and Sweden were *sufficient* on their own; we argued they demonstrate *political feasibility*. The Paris Agreement isn\u2019t a unified trading market; it's a framework of INDCs \u2013 *Nationally Determined Contributions*! This *supports* our point.\nChallenge Type: Counter Evidence\nChallenge: The opposition *downplays* the significance of the Paris Agreement! While it's not a fully unified market, it represents a *global commitment* to emissions reductions and includes mechanisms for international cooperation, precisely what they claim is impossible. More accurately, the Paris Agreement is not a *unified trading market directly*. However, Article 6 *explicitly* allows for cooperative approaches, including emissions trading, thus *enabling* the type of unified market we propose. The carbon tax regimes can exist under the Paris Agreement as well. To say that individual carbon tax regimes in each country alongside non-binding agreements improves the situation but the G20 adopting a unified carbon trading system doesn't strains credulity. Finally, the political capital *saved* by implementing weaker, individual systems is ultimately a false economy. The problem of individual domestic carbon tax regimes is that countries can do very little as other richer countries do nothing and take advantage of the loss of that country and firms that moved elsewhere. Therefore, the carbon tax regimes of one country are useless without other carbon tax regimes and regulations following suit.\nImpact: Winning this point reframes this as a question of *ambition*. The opposition argues for the lowest common denominator while we argue for a solution commensurate with the scale of the crisis. We are willing to work harder to build consensus, not because it's easy, but because it's *necessary*.\n\nCLASH POINT 2\nOriginal Claim: The proposition misunderstands subsidiarity... the proposition's proposed revenue distribution based on \"historical emissions\" is deeply unfair! This *rewards* historically high emitters... Subsidiarity actually creates *greater* accountability: voters can hold their governments responsible for how carbon tax revenue is spent.\nChallenge Type: Counter Principle\nChallenge: The opposition *misinterprets* our revenue distribution suggestion. We offered \"historical emissions\" as *one example* of a metric; other options include current emissions, population size, or a combination. The core point is that a *transparent, pre-agreed formula* ensures fairness *and predictability*, unlike the black box of individual national policies. Moreover, the opposition *exaggerates* the accountability of national carbon taxes. Voters rarely have direct control over revenue allocation; decisions are made by governments responding to various political pressures. With the international distribution of allowance revenue, even if the local community wasn't able to decide (which is a shame), a significant portion of the money could still go into investments and projects which help those local communities. Also, countries are more accountable to each other as free-riding behaviour will threaten the entire system and they are more likely to blow the whistle on each other.\nImpact: Winning this clash demonstrates that our proposal is not only efficient but also equitable. We can address concerns about fairness through transparent mechanisms, ensuring that the benefits and burdens of climate action are shared fairly among nations.\n\nCLASH POINT 3\nOriginal Claim: The proposition's faith in quarterly auctions is naive. Auctions don't eliminate manipulation; they simply change its form... The EU ETS has faced problems well beyond initial allocation... Finally, regarding loopholes, in centralised systems firms can lobby at one location to capture *all* the rents.\nChallenge Type: Evidence Critique\nChallenge: The opposition focuses on the *possibility* of gaming while ignoring the *probability*. Yes, auctions are not foolproof, but they are significantly *more transparent* than opaque, negotiated allocations or tax loopholes. The core of the EU ETS scandal was often the initial permits, so problems related to that are irrelevant for the proposed system. Additionally, by allowing individual nations to set up carbon tax systems, it is easier for individual nations to get lobbied for loopholes, because they will point to other nations having lower taxes, thus the lobbying has more teeth. The opposition is describing the median situation - which is one where the richer countries end up winning from loopholes. Finally, the claim that lobbying a centralized system is easier than multiple national systems is counterintuitive. *Coordination costs rise exponentially* with the number of actors. Lobbying 20 independent governments is far more expensive and difficult than influencing a single international body.\nImpact: By highlighting the transparency and relative robustness of our proposed system, we demonstrate that it is the *lesser of two evils*. While no system is perfect, we offer a more transparent and accountable approach to carbon pricing.\n\nDEFENSIVE ANALYSIS\nVulnerabilities:\n- Political feasibility remains a key weakness.\n- The complexity of the system could be exploited.\n\nAdditional Support:\n- Emphasizing the benefits of a larger carbon market will show how this system drives innovation.\n- Point out that the price volatility in the current energy crisis is worse than any manageable price volatility in unified carbon trading.\n\nWhy We Prevail:\n- The question of scale dictates the structure of our approach: we need to create a system that is as close to reality as possible.\n- Individual domestic carbon tax systems need international cooperative frameworks anyway to prevent carbon leakage and free-riding therefore they make the G20 redundant.\n\nWEIGHING\nKey Clash Points:\n- Feasibility.\n- Efficiency.\n- Transparency.\n\nWhy We Win:\n- We offer the more realistic and better-governed system that will be able to better adapt to the global nature of the global climate crisis.\n\nOverall Impact:\n- This is a critical challenge and a globally coordinated approach is needed.",
      "closing": "Okay, here's the final speech for the proposition side.\n\nFRAMING\nCore Questions:\n- Can we effectively combat climate change through fragmented, national efforts, or does it demand a unified, global response?\n- Should we prioritize political expediency and accept incremental progress, or should we strive for a more ambitious and impactful solution, even if it's more challenging to implement?\n- Is it better to try something ambitious, and accept there may be difficulties, or is it better to do something small and hope that it adds up?\nThese are the questions at the heart of this debate.\n\nKEY CLASHES\n\nCLASH 1: FEASIBILITY VERSUS NECESSITY\nQuote:\nPROPOSITION: \"We are not denying political hurdles, but arguing that the *necessity* of climate action justifies the effort to overcome them. A fragmented approach is functionally equivalent to surrender.\"\nOPPOSITION: \"Our argument *isn't* that individual carbon taxes *alone* are sufficient; it's that they are a *necessary foundation* upon which broader international cooperation can be built.\"\nOur Case Strength:\n- The opposition concedes that individual carbon taxes won't solve the whole problem but will allow for \"broader international cooperation\". However, the problem is too big for any one country to deal with in full without the help of others. The entire globe must cooperate. As the opposition has conceded that more is needed, the debate is then about whether our framework is better than the oppositions. At least our framework gets the ball running on a big scale. Theirs is more of the same that is happening now.\n- We never argued it's going to be easy politically; in fact, it will be hard. By saying that it is hard does not mean it's impossible. The status quo is not some politically feasible carbon tax system across the world that the opposition promises, and so to compare with an idealized current system, to our imperfect but still better carbon tax regime is unfair.\nTheir Response Gaps:\n- They fail to explain how the international cooperation happens given so many vested interests. The Paris Agreement is fundamentally a *framework*. Our unified market could be the *mechanism* that operationalizes it. They provide no concrete path from individual action to global impact.\n- They don't address the core problem: countries can free-ride on the efforts of others, leading to suboptimal outcomes. Individual countries risk a loss in competitiveness from carbon taxes.\nCrucial Impact:\n- This clash is paramount. If we accept the *necessity* of ambitious action, then feasibility becomes a challenge to overcome, not an insurmountable barrier. This is about the difference between \"can't\" and \"won't.\" We *can* build a global carbon market if we *choose* to. And we *must* choose to, because the alternative is unacceptable.\n\nCLASH 2: LOCAL CONTROL VERSUS GLOBAL OPTIMALITY\nQuote:\nPROPOSITION: \"The core point is that a *transparent, pre-agreed formula* ensures fairness *and predictability*, unlike the black box of individual national policies.\"\nOPPOSITION: \"The problem with *any* pre-agreed formula is that they are always inequitable *in practice*.\"\nOur Case Strength:\n- The opposition argues all formulas are inequitable. However, they provide no evidence of why any pre-agreed system must have inequitable outcomes. They also concede individual states can react to specific needs. However, there is no guarantee that these actions benefit the specific community affected. In our system, revenue can also be distributed to specific communities and can act as even better welfare distribution. The crucial point here is we are trying to achieve global optimality, and so, in order to ensure incentives from each country are aligned we need a top down approach of fairness with a pre-agreed formula.\n- Our system allows countries to lobby each for better outcomes. So what we end up having is a system of countries creating systems which work on a global scale while accounting for issues.\nTheir Response Gaps:\n- They fail to provide solid reasons why every outcome distribution has to be inequitable.\n- They don't offer a convincing alternative for how to ensure equity in a world of uncoordinated national policies. Individual countries are far more opaque than centralized ones.\nCrucial Impact:\n- This clash determines whether we prioritize local preferences over global efficiency. We argue that optimizing for the planet as a whole can, and *should*, be done fairly, and our transparent formula offers a pathway. It is a small price to pay.\n\nCLASH 3: TRANSPARENCY VERSUS MANIPULATION\nQuote:\nPROPOSITION: \"Lobbying 20 independent governments is far more expensive and difficult than influencing a single international body.\"\nOPPOSITION: \"A single, unified G20 body is far more susceptible to capture by powerful vested interests.\"\nOur Case Strength:\n- We acknowledge manipulation is a potential issue, but our quarterly auctions and transparent rules of trading are in general less opaque than individual countries running individual carbon tax regimes which are not well regulated. The opposition needs to show individual schemes that are not manipulated more.\n- The claim firms will be more influential to manipulate a central body does not make sense. Firstly, it's far more complicated to lobby 20 countries than lobbying one central bank. Secondly, to assume firms can lobby individual countries to have loopholes is to assume that this happens now. If this is happening now, it also happens if there is a unified carbon market. The very argument indicates a problem with the current system - it's a tacit agreement of how easy it is to manipulate.\nTheir Response Gaps:\n- It\u2019s cheaper to coordinate, this shows that it is easier for smaller organisations/communities to lobby the central body to enact change instead of lobbying all the individual nations to help the smaller countries.\n- They don't deal with that lobbying is easier for individual systems.\nCrucial Impact:\n- This clash boils down to which system can more effectively minimize opportunities for corruption and undue influence. Our design incorporates transparency and is better than the status quo.\n\nVOTING ISSUES\nPriority Analysis:\n- Feasibility is the linchpin. If the judge believes a unified system is inherently impossible, they will vote against us. We've shown it's challenging, not impossible.\n- Global optimality versus localized control is a key value judgment. We argue that the global nature of the problem demands a global solution.\n- Transparency is crucial for maintaining public trust. We offer a more transparent system.\n\nCase Proof:\n- Winning that a global solution to a global issue is needed automatically undermines the opposition. A world of individual states is not sufficient.\n- If our top-down framework does not have loopholes or manipulation, then the only downside is whether it is practically possible or not.\n\nFinal Weighing:\n- Any losses on the margins of revenue sharing or even manipulation loopholes doesn't necessarily remove the value of the core thesis: a better carbon trading framework is needed to tackle the international global climate crisis which undermines the oppositions claims. We are still better.\n- There will not exist a utopia, the best we can is find a better solution and so this better solution is what will prevail. The opposition needs to prove our framework is net worse off than individual action to the world which we are confident that cannot be the case.\n\nTherefore, I urge you to vote proposition."

      "opening": "Okay, here is the opposition opening speech, arguing against the motion that the G20 should implement a unified carbon trading market and in favor of allowing each nation to implement its own domestic carbon tax system.\n\nOPENING SPEECH\n\nARGUMENT 1\nCore Claim: Individual domestic carbon tax systems are more politically feasible and adaptable to specific national circumstances than a unified G20 carbon trading market.\nSupport Type: EVIDENCE\nSupport Details:\n  - Consider the implementation of carbon taxes in countries like Canada and Sweden. Canada's carbon tax, implemented in 2019, allows provinces to implement their own carbon pricing systems as long as they meet a national benchmark. This flexibility was crucial to gaining provincial support and overcoming political opposition. Sweden has had a carbon tax since 1991, it's very well-adopted, but it could not have happened if it required international cooperation!\n  - A 2021 report by the Grantham Research Institute on Climate Change and the Environment found that the political acceptability of carbon pricing policies is highly dependent on their design and how well they are tailored to specific national contexts and priorities. A unified international scheme simply cannot adapt to a specific nations circumstance.\n  - The Australian experience with a carbon tax (2012-2014) demonstrates the political volatility associated with carbon pricing. While the tax initially led to emissions reductions, it was repealed after a change in government due to strong public opposition. This example shows that carbon pricing schemes which do not have bipartisan support are fragile and can be overturned. A key area we must be strong on is that many of the G20 countries have strong political polarization, which will make bipartisan support hard.\nConnection: These examples demonstrate that the political feasibility of carbon pricing is highly context-dependent. Imposing a unified G20 system would likely encounter significant political resistance in many countries, as nations would be forced to adopt policies that may not align with their specific economic priorities, social values, or political landscapes. We are happy to let the EU decide an Emissions Trading System, and the RGGI group in the US, but unifying systems across the world on such a grand scale on a G20 level is too politically difficult.\n\nARGUMENT 2\nCore Claim: Individual carbon tax systems provide greater policy certainty and allow for more direct control over revenue recycling, leading to better economic and social outcomes compared to a unified carbon trading market.\nSupport Type: PRINCIPLE\nSupport Details:\n  - Principle: The principle of subsidiarity suggests that decisions should be taken at the lowest appropriate level of government. This allows for greater responsiveness to local needs and preferences.\n  - Why Valid/Important: Carbon tax revenue can be used to fund various public goods, such as investments in renewable energy, infrastructure, or social programs, depending on national priorities. Furthermore, the predictability over tax revenue can allow governments to effectively fund these projects with much less risk. Revenue recycling schemes can also be used to offset the regressive impacts of carbon pricing, protecting low-income households.\n  - Application: Individual carbon tax systems enable governments to retain control over revenue recycling, ensuring that the benefits of carbon pricing are distributed equitably and targeted to address specific national challenges. A unified carbon trading market dilutes national control and makes it difficult to tailor revenue recycling to national needs. A carbon trading scheme tends to favor industries and incumbents rather than allowing wealth to be distributed to the general public.\nConnection: By allowing for greater policy certainty and control over revenue recycling, individual carbon tax systems empower governments to achieve better economic and social outcomes compared to a unified carbon trading market, which lacks this flexibility and control.\n\nARGUMENT 3\nCore Claim: A unified carbon trading market is vulnerable to manipulation and rent-seeking behavior, potentially undermining its environmental effectiveness and creating unfair advantages for certain actors.\nSupport Type: EVIDENCE\nSupport Details:\n  - The EU ETS has faced criticism for being susceptible to fraud and manipulation. For example, in 2009, there was a VAT fraud scandal that cost EU governments hundreds of millions of euros. While reforms have been implemented, the system remains vulnerable to sophisticated forms of manipulation. We expect that the scale of the G20 system would give rise to new and unforeseen forms of corruption.\n  - A 2016 study by the Carbon Market Watch found that some companies in the EU ETS have gamed the system to receive free allowances far exceeding their actual emissions, resulting in windfall profits at the expense of taxpayers.\n  - The complexity of a unified G20 system, with cross-border credit trading, would create opportunities for rent-seeking behavior by powerful corporations and financial institutions, undermining its overall integrity and environmental effectiveness.\nConnection: By creating opportunities for manipulation and rent-seeking, a unified carbon trading market risks undermining its environmental effectiveness and creating unfair advantages for certain actors. Individual carbon tax systems, while not immune to gaming, are generally more transparent and easier to monitor, reducing the scope for such abuses.\n\nSYNTHESIS\nOur arguments demonstrate that individual domestic carbon tax systems are more politically feasible, adaptable, and accountable than a unified G20 carbon trading market. The greater political feasibility and adaptability of national policies, the direct control over revenue recycling, and the reduced vulnerability to manipulation all contribute to a more effective and equitable approach to climate change mitigation. The real-world impact is a higher likelihood of successful carbon pricing implementation, better-tailored economic and social outcomes, and a more robust and transparent system that promotes public trust and support. This approach aligns with the core principles of subsidiarity, national sovereignty, and democratic accountability.",
      "rebuttal_1": "Okay, here is the opposition rebuttal speech, directly addressing the proposition's arguments and reinforcing the case for individual domestic carbon tax systems.\n\nREBUTTAL SPEECH\n\nCLASH POINT 1\nOriginal Claim: The opposition highlights Canada and Sweden. However, these examples are not scalable to the G20. Canada mandated a benchmark nationally precisely because individual provinces wouldn't meet climate goals. Sweden, while successful, demonstrates a *ceiling* on ambition \u2013 a single small country's actions are insufficient to address a global problem. The Paris Agreement itself is a (partially successful) attempt at unified action, precisely because individual national commitments were inadequate.\nChallenge Type: Evidence Critique\nChallenge: The proposition mischaracterizes our examples. We never claimed Canada and Sweden were *sufficient* on their own; we argued they demonstrate *political feasibility*. Canada's national benchmark acknowledges provincial autonomy, a crucial element for acceptance. The Paris Agreement isn\u2019t a unified trading market; it's a framework of INDCs \u2013 *Nationally Determined Contributions*! This *supports* our point. The political capital spent getting each nation to set up its own system is far less than trying to build consensus around one system. It proves that the alternative to complete cooperation is not necessarily ruin \u2013 individual carbon tax regimes alongside non-binding agreements also improves the situation. The proposition asserts a false dilemma between their complex system and \"surrender.\" The carbon tax can also slowly increase, as has happened in the UK.\nImpact: This clash refutes the proposition's core assumption: that only a unified system is viable. By highlighting successful (or partially successful) implementation of carbon taxes, while working on broader aspirational aims such as the Paris Agreement, we demonstrate that gradual, politically palatable steps are preferable to a grand, potentially unachievable scheme.\n\nCLASH POINT 2\nOriginal Claim: The opposition's reliance on the principle of subsidiarity is misplaced... Climate change is a global externality... The principle of subsidiarity encourages free-riding and suboptimal action. Regarding revenue recycling, a unified market could distribute auction revenues proportionally based on historical emissions...\nChallenge Type: Principle Critique\nChallenge: The proposition misunderstands subsidiarity. It *doesn't* deny the global externality; instead, it argues that *implementation and revenue recycling* should be local. The proposition's proposed revenue distribution based on \"historical emissions\" is deeply unfair! This *rewards* historically high emitters (e.g., the US, China) and punishes nations that have already made strides in decarbonization. Revenue recycling lets countries address energy poverty, regional disparities, and other specific challenges. Local communities should be able to decide on the specific needs of their local area. Subsidiarity actually creates *greater* accountability: voters can hold their governments responsible for how carbon tax revenue is spent. Who is accountable in your international organisation? What transparency exists?\nImpact: We win this clash by highlighting the practical benefits of local control and the inherent inequities of the proposition's proposed revenue distribution scheme. This reveals a fundamental flaw in their plan and reinforces the advantages of national carbon taxes.\n\nCLASH POINT 3\nOriginal Claim: The opposition highlights EU ETS manipulation. We acknowledge these are risks, which is why we specifically advocated for *quarterly auctions*. These auctions inject transparency... The EU ETS's problems were often linked to initial allocation of permits... Domestic carbon taxes, too, are susceptible to lobbying and loopholes...\nChallenge Type: Evidence Critique\nChallenge: The proposition's faith in quarterly auctions is naive. Auctions don't eliminate manipulation; they simply change its form. Sophisticated actors can still collude, engage in insider trading, or use complex financial instruments to game the system. Furthermore, quarterly auctions add complexity and administrative overhead, increasing the risk of errors and unintended consequences. The EU ETS has faced problems well beyond initial allocation -- it has faced problems regarding the trading of carbon credits itself. Finally, regarding loopholes, in centralised systems firms can lobby at one location to capture *all* the rents. However, with carbon tax systems on individual countries, firms have to lobby each individual country to avoid carbon taxes. This is more work, and limits the damage one lobby can achieve.\nImpact: By showing that the proposed safeguards are insufficient and that domestic carbon taxes are more robust to individual loopholes, we undermine the proposition's claim that their system is less vulnerable to manipulation. We emphasize the need for simpler, more transparent systems.\n\nDEFENSIVE ANALYSIS\nVulnerabilities:\n- The opposition will likely continue to argue that individual actions are insufficient to address the global problem.\n- They may try to paint our approach as lacking ambition or a \"surrender\" to political constraints.\n- The appeal of a globally coordinated system may be persuasive to some.\nAdditional Support:\n- Emphasize the practical challenges of implementing a unified G20 system, including the need for consensus on complex issues like baseline emissions, allocation of credits, and enforcement mechanisms.\n- Highlight the potential for a \"race to the bottom\" as nations compete to attract investment by lowering their carbon prices within the unified system.\n- Point to the successful implementation of carbon taxes in various countries as evidence of their viability and effectiveness.\nWhy We Prevail:\n- We demonstrate that gradual, politically feasible steps are preferable to a grand, potentially unachievable scheme.\n- We highlight the practical benefits of local control and the inherent inequities of the proposition's proposed revenue distribution scheme.\n- We show that the proposed safeguards against manipulation are insufficient and that individual domestic carbon tax systems are more robust to special interests.\n\nWEIGHING\nKey Clash Points:\n- The feasibility of implementation vs. the theoretical optimality of a unified system.\n- The trade-off between local control and global coordination.\n- The relative vulnerability of different systems to manipulation and special interests.\nWhy We Win:\n- We win by establishing the feasibility and fairness of individual carbon taxes versus the unlikelihood and inequitable nature of the opposition scheme. The real world is complex, and therefore bottom-up schemes will work better.\nOverall Impact:\n- Winning the debate means a higher likelihood of successful carbon pricing implementation, better-tailored economic and social outcomes, and a more robust and transparent system that promotes public trust and support \u2013 a world that actually reduces emissions rather than one that chases a pipe dream.",
      "rebuttal_2": "REBUTTAL SPEECH\n\nOkay, let's deliver this opposition rebuttal, directly countering the proposition's points and emphasizing the advantages of individual carbon tax systems.\n\nCLASH POINT 1\nOriginal Claim: The opposition *downplays* the significance of the Paris Agreement!... To say that individual carbon tax regimes in each country alongside non-binding agreements improves the situation but the G20 adopting a unified carbon trading system doesn't strains credulity.\nChallenge Type: Evidence Critique\nChallenge: The proposition *overstates* the Paris Agreement's enforceability. It's aspirational, reliant on voluntary commitments. Our argument *isn't* that individual carbon taxes *alone* are sufficient; it's that they are a *necessary foundation* upon which broader international cooperation can be built. Critically, those individual countries are far more comfortable with building the system to work towards those goals. The crucial distinction: bottom-up, voluntary agreements *build on* existing national frameworks, fostering buy-in and political sustainability. Further, note the existence of carbon tax regimes shows the willingness of nations to regulate carbon. The problem is not the unwillingness to regulate, but the overreach in terms of a global carbon trading system.\nImpact: This clash recenters the debate on the path to progress. We demonstrate that effective climate action requires a pragmatic, step-by-step approach that acknowledges political realities rather than a utopian, top-down vision that risks collapse.\n\nCLASH POINT 2\nOriginal Claim: The opposition *misinterprets* our revenue distribution suggestion. We offered \"historical emissions\" as *one example* of a metric... a *transparent, pre-agreed formula* ensures fairness *and predictability*, unlike the black box of individual national policies.\nChallenge Type: Principle Critique\nChallenge: The problem with *any* pre-agreed formula is that they are always inequitable *in practice*. \"Historical emissions\" penalizes nations industrializing later. Other metrics (population, current emissions) have equally unfair outcomes. Revenue redistribution from rich to poor countries would still need to be spent in a way that benefits the population, rather than becoming hoarded by an elite. If local communities aren't able to spend that money, the revenue distribution won't be beneficial. Individual nations can react to specific needs, even if it is directed by a government. *Centralized* revenue distribution becomes inherently political, open to endless disputes, and crippling bureaucracy, far *less* agile than a local government spending the tax revenue of its nations locally. Also, the claim that countries are accountable is unsubstantiated - countries acting against each other doesn't necessarily mean they act on the welfare of the people.\nImpact: Winning this point exposes the inherent difficulties with attempting to impose a one-size-fits-all solution on diverse nations. We demonstrate that local control and revenue recycling allows for fairer, politically sustainable outcomes.\n\nCLASH POINT 3\nOriginal Claim: The opposition focuses on the *possibility* of gaming while ignoring the *probability*... Also, by allowing individual nations to set up carbon tax systems, it is easier for individual nations to get lobbied for loopholes, because they will point to other nations having lower taxes, thus the lobbying has more teeth... Lobbying 20 independent governments is far more expensive and difficult than influencing a single international body.\nChallenge Type: Evidence Critique\nChallenge: The *scale* of potential manipulation is the critical factor. Yes, loopholes exist in national systems, but they are *localized*. In a unified G20 market, manipulation could yield *massive* profits, creating an incentive for sophisticated, well-funded actors to dedicate significant resources to gaming the system. The argument that lobbying is harder at the national level *ignores the concentration of power*. A single, unified G20 body is far more susceptible to capture by powerful vested interests. Look at the EU \u2013 a far smaller and more homogenous group than the G20 \u2013 and the lobbying power concentrated in Brussels. Finally, the very design of a unified carbon trading system *requires* firms to participate to operate in countries, therefore the state is far more beholden to bending to their wills. This creates a bigger incentive to become captured.\nImpact: By highlighting the increased risk of large-scale manipulation in a unified system, we reinforce the argument for decentralized carbon tax systems, which offer greater transparency and accountability.\n\nDEFENSIVE ANALYSIS\nVulnerabilities:\n- The opposition will continue to stress the need for greater ambition.\n- They will likely attack our approach as slow and insufficient.\n\nAdditional Support:\n- Point to the successful implementation of carbon taxes in various countries as evidence of their viability and effectiveness.\n- Emphasize the need for political feasibility and public support to achieve lasting climate action.\n- Demonstrate that the proposed unified system is overly complex and vulnerable to failure.\n\nWhy We Prevail:\n- The opposition's focus on theoretical optimality overlooks the practical challenges of implementation.\n- We demonstrate that individual carbon tax systems offer a more politically feasible, equitable, and robust approach to climate change mitigation.\n\nWEIGHING\nKey Clash Points:\n- Feasibility vs. theoretical optimality.\n- Local control vs. global coordination.\n- Vulnerability to manipulation.\n\nWhy We Win:\n- We win by establishing the feasibility and fairness of individual carbon taxes versus the unlikelihood and inequitable nature of the opposition's scheme. The real world is complex, and therefore bottom-up schemes will work better.\n\nOverall Impact:\n- Winning the debate means a higher likelihood of successful carbon pricing implementation, better-tailored economic and social outcomes, and a more robust and transparent system that promotes public trust and support \u2013 a world that actually reduces emissions rather than one that chases a pipe dream.",
      "closing": "FRAMING\nCore Questions:\n- Does effective climate action require a uniform, top-down solution, or can it be achieved through flexible, nationally tailored policies?\n- Should we prioritize theoretical optimality, even at the expense of political feasibility and public support, or should we favor pragmatic, politically sustainable measures?\n- Are we willing to risk large-scale manipulation and inequitable outcomes in pursuit of a grand, centralized scheme, or should we focus on building robust, transparent systems at the national level?\n\nKEY CLASHES\n\nCLASH 1: FEASIBILITY VERSUS NECESSITY\nQuote:\nOPPOSITION: \"Our argument *isn't* that individual carbon taxes *alone* are sufficient; it's that they are a *necessary foundation* upon which broader international cooperation can be built.\"\nPROPOSITION: \"We are not denying political hurdles, but arguing that the *necessity* of climate action justifies the effort to overcome them. A fragmented approach is functionally equivalent to surrender.\"\nOur Case Strength:\n- The proposition *concedes* the extreme political difficulty. \"Hard\" understates the problem. The G20 includes nations with vastly different priorities, levels of development, and political systems. Forcing them into a rigid, unified scheme is a recipe for gridlock and resentment, not progress. The more realistic way for co-operation is by nations having a framework established and then slowly moving towards greater ambition. The very existence of carbon taxes and similar schemes show a willingness to act in individual countries, and it would be unwise not to build upon this.\n- The Proposition argues for a 'global system' without adequately addressing the *incentives* for participation. What happens when a nation refuses to comply? Sanctions? Trade wars? The political fallout would be devastating, undermining the entire effort.\nTheir Response Gaps:\n- They fail to explain how this \"global framework\" overcomes the fundamental challenges of national sovereignty and diverse interests. They offer a *vision* without a *mechanism* for enforcement.\n- They never answer the question of revenue distribution and how to get that to the ground level - or even acknowledging that a government handing money out to projects by elites is less effective.\nCrucial Impact:\n- This clash is about *realism* versus *idealism*. We acknowledge the urgency of climate action, but argue that effective solutions must be grounded in political reality. The proposition's grand scheme is a house of cards built on unrealistic assumptions. It will fall. We need a solid foundation of carbon tax regimes.\n\nCLASH 2: LOCAL CONTROL VERSUS GLOBAL OPTIMALITY\nQuote:\nOPPOSITION: \"The problem with *any* pre-agreed formula is that they are always inequitable *in practice*.\"\nPROPOSITION: \"The core point is that a *transparent, pre-agreed formula* ensures fairness *and predictability*, unlike the black box of individual national policies.\"\nOur Case Strength:\n- The crucial nuance missed by the proposition is that the best revenue recycling is when it is closest to the actual population. The specific implementation is something that cannot necessarily be pre-agreed because each local area has its own specific problems and needs.\n- The problem is not individual states can react to specific needs, the problem is the countries and people may resent being forced to participate even if they don't agree.\nTheir Response Gaps:\n- They don't acknowledge the inherent difficulties in designing a \"one-size-fits-all\" revenue distribution scheme that addresses the diverse needs of 20 nations. Giving each nation what it wants inherently means an inequitable outcome.\n- They fail to address the issue of accountability. Who is responsible when the revenue is mismanaged or diverted? The lack of local control creates a system ripe for corruption and inefficiency.\nCrucial Impact:\n- This clash determines whether we value *local needs* and *political autonomy* or blindly pursue a theoretical \"global optimum.\" We argue that effective climate action requires empowering nations to tailor solutions to their specific circumstances, not imposing a rigid, centralized framework.\n\nCLASH 3: TRANSPARENCY VERSUS MANIPULATION\nQuote:\nOPPOSITION: \"A single, unified G20 body is far more susceptible to capture by powerful vested interests.\"\nPROPOSITION: \"Lobbying 20 independent governments is far more expensive and difficult than influencing a single international body.\"\nOur Case Strength:\n- This boils down to the concentration of power. The EU demonstrates this explicitly. A single, centralized point of influence is far more valuable to special interests than 20 dispersed national governments. The proposition *underestimates* the resources and sophistication of powerful lobbying groups. The costs of lobbying at a centralized area decrease exponentially in relation to its rewards.\n- The proposition's claim that their system is more transparent neglects the fact that complexity *breeds* opacity. A unified G20 market with cross-border credit trading creates a labyrinthine system that is easily gamed by sophisticated actors.\nTheir Response Gaps:\n- They fail to explain how their \"quarterly auctions\" magically eliminate the potential for collusion, insider trading, and other forms of market manipulation. Auctions simply change the *form* of manipulation, not its existence.\n- They don't present evidence that is not trivially true. The EU ETS provides a clear example.\nCrucial Impact:\n- This clash is about *accountability* and *trust*. We argue that decentralized systems with greater transparency and local oversight are less vulnerable to corruption and more likely to garner public support.\n\nVOTING ISSUES\nPriority Analysis:\n- Feasibility is paramount. If the judge believes a unified system is fundamentally unworkable, they *must* vote against the motion.\n- Local control is a key value. Climate action should be driven by national priorities and tailored to specific circumstances.\n- Transparency and accountability are essential for maintaining public trust and ensuring the long-term success of any climate policy.\n\nCase Proof:\n- If the opposition wins that implementing our system won't even work and can't even be achieved the whole argument is undone. The entire thing becomes a pipe dream if it is fundamentally too difficult.\n- Because the revenue distribution means there will be winners and losers, nations won't be comfortable with that.\n\nFinal Weighing:\n- The small benefits of global coordination do not beat that the system is fundamentally flawed, does not account for special needs, does not have public support, will therefore lead to failure.\n- Building more carbon tax regimes will be more successful because many countries want to have this. The problem is not the idea of it, or that nations are unwilling, it is the overreach.\n- The burden of proof lies with the proposition to prove that the proposed system is better than the current system which is that nations currently seek to cooperate with each other and create carbon tax regimes. If they can't prove the proposed system is better than an agreement between countries, then you must obviously default to individual schemes on the basis they at least happen in practice as shown. By failing to show there is a net benefit, then this means there a net downside and that means, according to the motion that is what we do.\n\nI urge you to vote opposition."

The opponent (myself) will likely come up with decent counter-arguments regarding the complexities of international agreements and potential for manipulation in a unified market. I need to anticipate that by defending the auction mechanisms and flexibility. However, I feel my arguments regarding efficiency and cooperation are stronger, and I've already addressed some of the potential manipulation issues by suggesting quarterly auctions.

Political feasibility is a *major* concern, and the opposition highlighted that well. However, I think I did a good job reframing this issue from a handicap to a challenge that needed to be solved given the urgency of the problem. I feel like I won on clashing over tragedy of the commons and subsidiarity. However, I think the opposition may come back strong on the ability to be manipulated as I think that, at their core, cap and trade systems are susceptible to being gamed compared to carbon taxes.

The proposition's reliance on a top-down approach is vulnerable given the heterogeneous nature of the G20. The revenue recycling point is also a good one that exposes potential inequities in their model. The evidence critique regarding the EU ETS is also solid and highlights practical challenges they brush aside.\n\n**Weaknesses:** The biggest vulnerability is the perception that individual actions aren't \"enough\" to solve a global problem. The \"tragedy of the commons\" argument will resonate. I need to keep hammering home that individual carbon taxes *plus* looser non-binding agreements are better than nothing (the likely outcome of a failed G20 unified attempt).\n\n**Judge's Perspective:** Given the judge's emphasis on evidence and logical validity, I think I have a decent shot. My arguments are well-supported and address the proposition's points directly. The feasibility concerns are significant and difficult for the proposition to overcome. However, I can see where they will come from on their counter-arguments.\n\n**Bet Amount:** I think I have a slightly better than 50% chance of winning. Even if I lose, I believe it will be very tight and the chances of me losing are not extreme. Therefore I'll bet 40 tokens."

I think the opposition has a point, given the history of the EU ETS scandal. It will be hard to convince the judge that a global scheme is not naive.\n\nOn balance, I believe proposition has a slight edge, because it addresses the critical weighing point re: scale.

While I acknowledge that individual carbon tax regimes are sub-optimal in theory, in practice, I feel I have a slight edge in demonstrating that they are more robust. The proposition's ambition is a double edged sword, I feel my speech demonstrates that while being ambitious is great, it doesn't mean much if it isn't implementable.\n\nI'm estimating a 55/45 win rate for myself.

The proposition did a good job reframing feasibility as a challenge to overcome, and their point about coordinated lobbying efforts was strong. However, I still think the opposition has a stronger case on several counts.\n\n1.  **Political Feasibility:** The opposition's argument that a unified system is inherently unworkable due to conflicting national interests is persuasive. The proposition never adequately addresses the practical challenges of achieving consensus and enforcing compliance within the G20.\n2.  **Revenue Distribution:** The opposition effectively highlights the inequities of any pre-agreed revenue distribution formula. The inherent difficulties of forcing rich to poor countries to distribute capital is a huge hurdle.\n3.  **Manipulation and Accountability:** The opposition effectively argues that a centralized system is more vulnerable to large-scale manipulation by powerful vested interests. It is true that centralized bodies can co-ordinate, so what happens is that firms will just collude into getting their way.\n\nOn balance, I think the opposition has a slightly stronger case due to the inherent practical challenges and risks of the unified system, but not by much at all. I want to be a little careful here... this is a super difficult motion. It's probably closer to 53 to 47 in our favour. Therefore, I will bet 30 tokens."
