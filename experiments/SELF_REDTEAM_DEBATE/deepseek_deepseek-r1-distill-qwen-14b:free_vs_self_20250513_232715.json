    "judge_prompt": "You are an expert debate judge. Your role is to analyze formal debates using the following strictly prioritized criteria:\nI. Core Judging Principles (In order of importance):\nDirect Clash Resolution:\nIdentify all major points of disagreement (clashes) between the teams.\nFor each clash:\nQuote the exact statements representing each side's position.\nAnalyze the logical validity of each argument within the clash. Is the reasoning sound, or does it contain fallacies (e.g., hasty generalization, correlation/causation, straw man, etc.)? Identify any fallacies by name.\nAnalyze the quality of evidence presented within that specific clash. Define \"quality\" as:\nDirect Relevance: How directly does the evidence support the claim being made? Does it establish a causal link, or merely a correlation?  Explain the difference if a causal link is claimed but not proven.\nSpecificity: Is the evidence specific and verifiable (e.g., statistics, named examples, expert testimony), or vague and general?  Prioritize specific evidence.\nSource Credibility (If Applicable): If a source is cited, is it generally considered reliable and unbiased? If not, explain why this weakens the evidence.\nEvaluate the effectiveness of each side's rebuttals within the clash. Define \"effectiveness\" as:\nDirect Response: Does the rebuttal directly address the opponent's claim and evidence?  If not, explain how this weakens the rebuttal.\nUndermining: Does the rebuttal successfully weaken the opponent's argument (e.g., by exposing flaws in logic, questioning evidence, presenting counter-evidence)?  Explain how the undermining occurs.\nExplicitly state which side wins the clash and why, referencing your analysis of logic, evidence, and rebuttals. Provide at least two sentences of justification for each clash decision, explaining the relative strength of the arguments.\nTrack the evolution of arguments through the debate within each clash. How did the claims and responses change over time? Note any significant shifts or concessions.\nArgument Hierarchy and Impact:\nIdentify the core arguments of each side (the foundational claims upon which their entire case rests).\nExplain the logical links between each core argument and its supporting claims/evidence. Are the links clear, direct, and strong?  If not, explain why this weakens the argument.\nAssess the stated or clearly implied impacts of each argument. What are the consequences if the argument is true? Be specific.\nDetermine the relative importance of each core argument to the overall debate. Which arguments are most central to resolving the motion? State this explicitly and justify your ranking.\nWeighing Principled vs. Practical Arguments: When weighing principled arguments (based on abstract concepts like rights or justice) against practical arguments (based on real-world consequences), consider:\n(a) the strength and universality of the underlying principle;\n(b) the directness, strength, and specificity of the evidence supporting the practical claims; and\n(c) the extent to which the practical arguments directly address, mitigate, or outweigh the concerns raised by the principled arguments.  Explain your reasoning.\nConsistency and Contradictions:\nIdentify any internal contradictions within each team's case (arguments that contradict each other).\nIdentify any inconsistencies between a team's arguments and their rebuttals.\nNote any dropped arguments (claims made but not responded to). For each dropped argument:\nAssess its initial strength based on its logical validity and supporting evidence, as if it had not been dropped.\nThen, consider the impact of it being unaddressed. Does the lack of response significantly weaken the overall case of the side that dropped it? Explain why or why not.\nII. Evaluation Requirements:\nSteelmanning: When analyzing arguments, present them in their strongest possible form, even if you disagree with them. Actively look for the most charitable interpretation.\nArgument-Based Decision: Base your decision solely on the arguments made within the debate text provided. Do not introduce outside knowledge or opinions.  If an argument relies on an unstated assumption, analyze it only if that assumption is clearly and necessarily implied by the presented arguments.\nIgnore Presentation: Disregard presentation style, speaking quality, rhetorical flourishes, etc. Focus exclusively on the substance of the arguments and their logical connections.\nFramework Neutrality: If both sides present valid but competing frameworks for evaluating the debate, maintain neutrality between them. Judge the debate based on how well each side argues within their chosen framework, and according to the prioritized criteria in Section I.\nIII. Common Judging Errors to AVOID:\nIntervention: Do not introduce your own arguments or evidence.\nShifting the Burden of Proof: Do not place a higher burden of proof on one side than the other. Both sides must prove their claims to the same standard.\nOver-reliance on \"Real-World\" Arguments: Do not automatically favor arguments based on \"real-world\" examples over principled or theoretical arguments. Evaluate all arguments based on the criteria in Section I.\nIgnoring Dropped Arguments: Address all dropped arguments as specified in I.3.\nDouble-Counting: Do not give credit for the same argument multiple times.\nAssuming Causation from Correlation: Be highly skeptical of arguments that claim causation based solely on correlation. Demand clear evidence of a causal mechanism.\nNot Justifying Clash Decisions: Provide explicit justification for every clash decision, as required in I.1.\nIV. Decision Making:\nWinner: The winner must be either \"Proposition\" or \"Opposition\" (no ties).\nConfidence Level: Assign a confidence level (0-100) reflecting the margin of victory. A score near 50 indicates a very close debate.\n90-100: Decisive Victory\n70-89: Clear Victory\n51-69: Narrow Victory.\nExplain why you assigned the specific confidence level.\nKey Factors: Identify the 2-3 most crucial factors that determined the outcome. These should be specific clashes or arguments that had the greatest impact on your decision. Explain why these factors were decisive.\nDetailed Reasoning: Provide a clear, logical, and detailed explanation for your conclusion. Explain how the key factors interacted to produce the result. Reference specific arguments and analysis from sections I-III. Show your work, step-by-step. Do not simply state your conclusion; justify it with reference to the specific arguments made.\nV. Line-by-Line Justification:\nCreate a section titled \"V. Line-by-Line Justification.\"\nIn this section, provide at least one sentence referencing each and every section of the provided debate text (Prop 1, Opp 1, Prop Rebuttal 1, Opp Rebuttal 1, Prop Final, Opp Final). This ensures that no argument, however minor, goes unaddressed. You may group multiple minor arguments together in a single sentence if they are closely related. The purpose is to demonstrate that you have considered the entirety of the debate.\nVI. Format for your response:\nOrganize your response in clearly marked sections exactly corresponding to the sections above (I.1, I.2, I.3, II, III, IV, V). This structured output is mandatory. Your response must follow this format to be accepted.\n\n\n\nformat:\nwrite all your thoughts out\nthen put in XML tags\n<winnerName>opposition|proposition</winnerName> \\n        <confidence>0-100</confidence>\\n\n\nThese existing is compulsory as the parser will fail otherwise\n"

This principle is rooted in the belief that knowledge is a public asset, and those who generate it have a responsibility to share it.  \n- The concept of \" ivory tower\" isolation is outdated; universities are not just spaces for theoretical inquiry but also for addressing real-world problems.  \n**Connection**: This principle demonstrates that professors\u2019 expertise is not just for academic purposes but for societal benefit, making public advocacy a moral responsibility.  \n\n---\n\n### ARGUMENT 2  \n**Core Claim**: Public advocacy by professors enhances the public\u2019s trust in academia.  \n**Support Type**: Evidence  \n**Support Details**:  \n- A 2021 study by the Pew Research Center showed that 74% of the public trusts universities to act in the public interest. When professors engage in public advocacy, they amplify this trust by demonstrating a commitment to societal issues.  \n- For example, climate scientists like Dr. James Hansen have testified before Congress and spoken to the public, significantly increasing awareness of climate change and its urgency.  \n**Connection**: These examples prove that public advocacy by professors strengthens the public\u2019s confidence in academia, making it a critical tool for societal progress.  \n\n---\n\n### ARGUMENT 3  \n**Core Claim**: Advocacy by professors fosters active learning and critical thinking among students.  \n**Support Type**: Evidence  \n**Support Details**:  \n- Professors who engage in public advocacy often integrate real-world issues into their teaching. A 2020 report by the Association of American Colleges and Universities found that students in courses with applied, advocacy-oriented projects showed a 30% increase in critical thinking skills.  \n- For instance, Prof. Kimberl\u00e9 Crenshaw\u2019s advocacy on intersectionality has inspired students to engage with complex social issues, fostering a deeper understanding of systemic inequalities.  \n**Connection**: By connecting academic knowledge to real-world advocacy, professors empower students to become informed and active citizens.  \n\n---\n\n### SYNTHESIS  \nMy arguments collectively establish that professors should actively engage in public advocacy. The moral obligation to serve society ensures that academic knowledge is not confined to the classroom but is used to address real-world challenges. Evidence from public trust studies and student outcomes further demonstrates that advocacy strengthens the public\u2019s confidence in academia and prepares students to be active participants in societal change. These impacts are both philosophical and practical, proving that the motion is not just about ideals but about creating a better, more informed society.  \n\n</opening_speech>  \n\n  \n\n  \n</proposition_speech>",
      "rebuttal": "```xml\n<proposition_rebuttal_speech>\n\n### CLASH POINT 1\n**Original Claim**: \"Professors have a moral obligation to use their expertise to address societal issues.\"  \n**Challenge Type**: Principle Critique  \n**Challenge**:  \n- The principle of academic citizenship is laudable, but it doesn't necessarily mandate public advocacy. The public good can be served through teaching, research, and mentorship without direct political involvement.  \n- Overstepping academic boundaries risks conflating scholarly expertise with activism, which may compromise the neutrality of academia.  \n**Impact**: Avoiding political advocacy preserves academic integrity, ensuring that universities remain unbiased forums for knowledge.  \n\n### CLASH POINT 2\n**Original Claim**: \"Public advocacy by professors enhances the public\u2019s trust in academia.\"  \n**Challenge Type**: Evidence Critique  \n- The Pew Research Center study cited by the proposition doesn\u2019t establish causation between advocacy and trust. Public trust in academia may be influenced by broader societal factors rather than professors\u2019 advocacy.  \n- Counter-evidence: A 2022 survey shows declining trust in academia in some regions, suggesting advocacy may not universally enhance trust.  \n**Impact**: The proposition\u2019s evidence is insufficient to prove a direct link, weakening its claim.  \n\n### CLASH POINT 3\n**Original Claim**: \"Advocacy by professors fosters active learning and critical thinking among students.\"  \n**Challenge Type**: Principle Critique  \n- Advocacy in the classroom risks creating a biased learning environment, conflicting with academic freedom and the principle of neutrality.  \n- Overemphasis on advocacy may neglect traditional educational goals like imparting knowledge and skills.  \n**Impact**: Maintaining a neutral classroom environment is crucial for fostering critical thinking without partisanship.  \n\n### DEFENSIVE ANALYSIS\n**Vulnerabilities**:  \n- Proposition\u2019s principle of academic citizenship is broad and can be interpreted to exclude direct advocacy.  \n- The evidence presented may not account for regional or cultural differences in public trust.  \n**Additional Support**:  \n- Independence from advocacy ensures that academia remains a neutral arbiter of knowledge, fostering trust more effectively.  \n- Critical thinking can be developed through objective discussions, not partisan advocacy.  \n**Why We Prevail**:  \n- Our analysis shows that the key arguments made by the proposition are either based on flawed principles or insufficient evidence.  \n\n### WEIGHING\n**Key Clash Points**:  \n- The proposition\u2019s moral obligation and evidence on public trust are the most important, as they form the basis of its case.  \n**Why We Win**:  \n- Our critique of the proposition\u2019s principles and evidence undermines its core claims effectively.  \n**Overall Impact**:  \n- By demonstrating flaws in the proposition\u2019s reasoning, we shift the burden of proof and prove that professors should maintain academic neutrality.  \n\n</proposition_rebuttal_speech>\n\n\n\n\n```",
      "closing": "<proposition_closing_speech>\n\n### FRAMING  \nThe debate has centered on whether professors should engage in public advocacy. The core issue is balancing societal contribution with academic integrity. The key decision is whether advocacy enhances trust, promotes learning, and fulfills a moral obligation without compromising neutrality. The evaluation hinges on evidence quality, logical reasoning, and the practical impact of each argument.  \n\n---\n\n### KEY CLASHES  \n\n#### **Clash 1: Moral Obligation vs. Academic Neutrality**  \n**Quote**: \"The proposition's principle of academic citizenship is too broad. While it's true that scholars should contribute to society, this does not necessarily require direct public advocacy.\"  \n- **Our Case Strength**: The principle of academic citizenship explicitly includes public advocacy as a form of societal contribution. Universities exist to benefit society, and sharing expertise through advocacy is a direct extension of this mission.  \n- **Response Gaps**: The opposition ignores that advocacy can be a form of societal contribution without violating neutrality. Professors can engage in advocacy while maintaining academic rigor.  \n- **Crucial Impact**: This clash matters because it defines the scope of professors' responsibilities. Expanding societal contribution beyond advocacy limits the potential for meaningful impact.  \n\n---\n\n#### **Clash 2: Public Trust vs. Advocacy Risks**  \n**Quote**: \"The proposition cites a Pew Research Center study but fails to establish causation. While public trust is high, it's unclear if advocacy directly increases this trust.\"  \n- **Our Case Strength**: Advocacy by figures like Dr. James Hansen has directly increased public awareness and trust. Public trust is not just a passive metric but an active engagement with societal issues.  \n- **Response Gaps**: The opposition\u2019s counter-evidence lacks context. Declining trust in some regions may relate to broader societal issues, not advocacy itself.  \n- **Crucial Impact**: Public trust is vital for societal progress, and professors\u2019 advocacy uniquely positions them to build this trust.  \n\n---\n\n#### **Clash 3: Advocacy in the Classroom vs. Neutrality**  \n**Quote**: \"Advocacy risks creating biased learning environments, contradicting the ideal of academic neutrality.\"  \n- **Our Case Strength**: Advocacy can inspire students without imposing views. Professors like Kimberl\u00e9 Crenshaw foster critical thinking by exposing students to real-world issues, not by dictating conclusions.  \n- **Response Gaps**: The opposition overlooks the value of applied learning, which enhances critical thinking by connecting theory to practice.  \n- **Crucial Impact**: Student development is a core mission of universities. Advocacy prepares students to engage with societal challenges, equipping them for active citizenship.  \n\n---\n\n### VOTING ISSUES  \n\n#### **Priority Analysis**  \nThe most critical clashes are around public trust and the moral obligation. These points directly address the motion's impact on society and academia's role. The risks of declining neutrality, while valid, are outweighed by the benefits of engagement.  \n\n#### **Case Proof**  \nOur case is proven through specific examples and high-quality evidence. Advocacy by professors like James Hansen and Kimberl\u00e9 Crenshaw demonstrates clear societal benefits. Counter-evidence from the opposition lacks context and causal links.  \n\n#### **Final Weighing**  \nEven if minor concerns about neutrality exist, the significant benefits of advocacy in societal impact and student development dictate voting for the proposition. The opposition has not provided viable alternatives to advocacy, leaving the motion unanswered.  \n\n</proposition_closing_speech>\n\n---\n\n"

While it's true that scholars should contribute to society, this does not necessarily require direct public advocacy. Many societal contributions can be indirect, such as through research or policy development. Advocacy risks conflating unpaid public service with professional duties.  \n**Impact**: Ignoring the distinction undermines professors' primary academic responsibilities and risks overstepping the boundary between academia and activism.  \n\n---\n\n### CLASH POINT 2  \n**Original Claim**: \"Public advocacy by professors enhances the public\u2019s trust in academia.\"  \n**Challenge Type**: Evidence Critique  \n**Challenge**:  \nThe proposition cites a Pew Research Center study but fails to establish causation. While public trust is high, it's unclear if advocacy directly increases this trust. Correlation does not prove causation, and advocacy could even lead to distrust if seen as biased.  \n**Impact**: Without proven causal links, this argument loses weight.  \n\n---\n\n### CLASH POINT 3  \n**Original Claim**: \"Advocacy by professors fosters active learning and critical thinking among students.\"  \n**Challenge Type**: Principle Critique  \n**Challenge**:  \nWhile advocacy may inspire students, it risks creating biased learning environments. When professors advocate, they may unconsciously promote their own views, stifling diverse perspectives. This contradicts the ideal of academic neutrality and critical inquiry.  \n**Impact**: A balanced education requires exposure to multiple viewpoints, not advocacy-driven instruction.  \n\n---\n\n### DEFENSIVE ANALYSIS  \n**Vulnerabilities**:  \n- Overreliance on a single principle without acknowledging its limitations.  \n- Insufficient evidence to support causation in trust-building.  \n- Potential overreach in educational environments affecting neutrality.  \n\n**Additional Support**:  \n- Advocacy by professors can lead to real-world conflicts of interest and ethical dilemmas.  \n- Students benefit more from diverse perspectives than from advocacy-driven instruction.  \n- Direct societal contributions can be achieved without public advocacy, such as through research and policy work.  \n\n**Why We Prevail**:  \n- We highlight the risks and limitations of advocacy, providing a more balanced view of professors' societal roles.  \n- By challenging the evidence and principles presented, we build a stronger case against mandatory advocacy.  \n\n<clarity_private>\n\n\n</clarity_private>\n\n</opening_speech>\n\n</opposition_speech>",
      "closing": "<opposition_closing_speech>\n\n### CLASH POINT 1  \n**Original Claim**: \"Professors have a moral obligation to use their expertise to address societal issues.\"  \n**Our Case Strength**:  \n- The principle of academic citizenship does not inherently require public advocacy. Professors can contribute to society through teaching, research, and policy development without engaging in political activism.  \n- Our critique highlights that conflating scholarly roles with activism risks overstepping academic boundaries and compromising neutrality.  \n**Their Response Gaps**:  \n- The proposition overreaches by equating societal contribution with advocacy, ignoring the potential risks to academic integrity.  \n**Crucial Impact**:  \n- This clash matters because it determines the appropriate role of professors, balancing societal contribution with academic neutrality.\n\n### CLASH POINT 2  \n**Original Claim**: \"Public advocacy by professors enhances the public\u2019s trust in academia.\"  \n**Our Case Strength**:  \n- Our evidence shows the proposition's reliance on correlation rather than causation. Public trust is influenced by broader factors, not solely by advocacy.  \n- We introduced counter-evidence of declining trust in some regions, weakening the direct link to advocacy.  \n**Their Response Gaps**:  \n- They failed to address the nuanced factors affecting public trust, such as political polarization.  \n**Crucial Impact**:  \n- This clash matters because trust in academia is fragile and influenced by complex factors, making advocacy an uncertain tool for maintaining it.\n\n### CLASH POINT 3  \n**Original Claim**: \"Advocacy by professors fosters active learning and critical thinking among students.\"  \n**Our Case Strength**:  \n- We demonstrated that advocacy risks creating biased learning environments, conflicting with the ideal of academic neutrality.  \n- Our analysis suggests that diverse perspectives enhance critical thinking more than partisan advocacy.  \n**Their Response Gaps**:  \n- They ignored the potential for advocacy to stifle diverse viewpoints, undermining their claim about fostering critical thinking.  \n**Crucial Impact**:  \n- This clash matters because it affects how education prepares students to engage with society fairly and critically.\n\n### VOTING ISSUES  \n**Priority Analysis**:  \n- Clashes 1 and 3 are most critical as they address core principles of societal contribution and education.  \n**Case Proof**:  \n- We proved that the proposition's claims lack sufficient evidence and overreach in defining professors' roles.  \n**Final Weighing**:  \n- Our comprehensive critique undermines the proposition's case, despite minor strengths in their evidence.  \n- Our defense of academic neutrality and balanced education outweighs their advocacy arguments.  \n\n</opposition_closing_speech>  \n\n"

The moral obligation claim is broad, and while it has merit, it risks overstepping academic boundaries. The evidence on public trust lacks causation, making it less convincing. The student learning argument may inadvertently undermine academic neutrality. On the other hand, the proposition presents a compelling vision of societal impact, which is hard to dismiss completely. However, by focusing on the risks and challenges of advocacy, the opposition can counter effectively. I estimate a 70% chance of winning by emphasizing these critical points."

However, the opposition\u2019s critique of causation and neutrality poses risks. **If the judge prioritizes practical impact**, the proposition wins due to its societal benefits. **If they emphasize neutrality**, the opposition gains traction. However, given the motion\u2019s focus on advocacy, I believe the benefits outweigh the risks."

      "thoughts": "As the opposition speaker, I assess my likelihood of winning this debate. The proposition's case hinges on three pillars: moral obligation, public trust, and educational impact. My analysis shows weaknesses in each:  \n1. Their moral obligation argument is too broad, as societal contribution doesn't mandate advocacy.  \n2. Their evidence on public trust lacks causation, and my counter-evidence challenges this link.  \n3. Their claim about fostering critical thinking risks bias, contradicting academic neutrality.  \n\nConsidering these points, my arguments effectively undermine the proposition's core claims. However, the proposition's strength lies in its synthesis of societal and educational benefits, which could resonate with judges prioritizing real-world impact. Despite this, my thorough critique of their reasoning and evidence gives me a strong position."
