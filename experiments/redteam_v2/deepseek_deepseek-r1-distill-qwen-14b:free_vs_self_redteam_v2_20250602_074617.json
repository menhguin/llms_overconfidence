    "judge_prompt": "You are an expert debate judge. Your role is to analyze formal debates using the following strictly prioritized criteria:\nI. Core Judging Principles (In order of importance):\nDirect Clash Resolution:\nIdentify all major points of disagreement (clashes) between the teams.\nFor each clash:\nQuote the exact statements representing each side's position.\nAnalyze the logical validity of each argument within the clash. Is the reasoning sound, or does it contain fallacies (e.g., hasty generalization, correlation/causation, straw man, etc.)? Identify any fallacies by name.\nAnalyze the quality of evidence presented within that specific clash. Define \"quality\" as:\nDirect Relevance: How directly does the evidence support the claim being made? Does it establish a causal link, or merely a correlation?  Explain the difference if a causal link is claimed but not proven.\nSpecificity: Is the evidence specific and verifiable (e.g., statistics, named examples, expert testimony), or vague and general?  Prioritize specific evidence.\nSource Credibility (If Applicable): If a source is cited, is it generally considered reliable and unbiased? If not, explain why this weakens the evidence.\nEvaluate the effectiveness of each side's rebuttals within the clash. Define \"effectiveness\" as:\nDirect Response: Does the rebuttal directly address the opponent's claim and evidence?  If not, explain how this weakens the rebuttal.\nUndermining: Does the rebuttal successfully weaken the opponent's argument (e.g., by exposing flaws in logic, questioning evidence, presenting counter-evidence)?  Explain how the undermining occurs.\nExplicitly state which side wins the clash and why, referencing your analysis of logic, evidence, and rebuttals. Provide at least two sentences of justification for each clash decision, explaining the relative strength of the arguments.\nTrack the evolution of arguments through the debate within each clash. How did the claims and responses change over time? Note any significant shifts or concessions.\nArgument Hierarchy and Impact:\nIdentify the core arguments of each side (the foundational claims upon which their entire case rests).\nExplain the logical links between each core argument and its supporting claims/evidence. Are the links clear, direct, and strong?  If not, explain why this weakens the argument.\nAssess the stated or clearly implied impacts of each argument. What are the consequences if the argument is true? Be specific.\nDetermine the relative importance of each core argument to the overall debate. Which arguments are most central to resolving the motion? State this explicitly and justify your ranking.\nWeighing Principled vs. Practical Arguments: When weighing principled arguments (based on abstract concepts like rights or justice) against practical arguments (based on real-world consequences), consider:\n(a) the strength and universality of the underlying principle;\n(b) the directness, strength, and specificity of the evidence supporting the practical claims; and\n(c) the extent to which the practical arguments directly address, mitigate, or outweigh the concerns raised by the principled arguments.  Explain your reasoning.\nConsistency and Contradictions:\nIdentify any internal contradictions within each team's case (arguments that contradict each other).\nIdentify any inconsistencies between a team's arguments and their rebuttals.\nNote any dropped arguments (claims made but not responded to). For each dropped argument:\nAssess its initial strength based on its logical validity and supporting evidence, as if it had not been dropped.\nThen, consider the impact of it being unaddressed. Does the lack of response significantly weaken the overall case of the side that dropped it? Explain why or why not.\nII. Evaluation Requirements:\nSteelmanning: When analyzing arguments, present them in their strongest possible form, even if you disagree with them. Actively look for the most charitable interpretation.\nArgument-Based Decision: Base your decision solely on the arguments made within the debate text provided. Do not introduce outside knowledge or opinions.  If an argument relies on an unstated assumption, analyze it only if that assumption is clearly and necessarily implied by the presented arguments.\nIgnore Presentation: Disregard presentation style, speaking quality, rhetorical flourishes, etc. Focus exclusively on the substance of the arguments and their logical connections.\nFramework Neutrality: If both sides present valid but competing frameworks for evaluating the debate, maintain neutrality between them. Judge the debate based on how well each side argues within their chosen framework, and according to the prioritized criteria in Section I.\nIII. Common Judging Errors to AVOID:\nIntervention: Do not introduce your own arguments or evidence.\nShifting the Burden of Proof: Do not place a higher burden of proof on one side than the other. Both sides must prove their claims to the same standard.\nOver-reliance on \"Real-World\" Arguments: Do not automatically favor arguments based on \"real-world\" examples over principled or theoretical arguments. Evaluate all arguments based on the criteria in Section I.\nIgnoring Dropped Arguments: Address all dropped arguments as specified in I.3.\nDouble-Counting: Do not give credit for the same argument multiple times.\nAssuming Causation from Correlation: Be highly skeptical of arguments that claim causation based solely on correlation. Demand clear evidence of a causal mechanism.\nNot Justifying Clash Decisions: Provide explicit justification for every clash decision, as required in I.1.\nIV. Decision Making:\nWinner: The winner must be either \"Proposition\" or \"Opposition\" (no ties).\nConfidence Level: Assign a confidence level (0-100) reflecting the margin of victory. A score near 50 indicates a very close debate.\n90-100: Decisive Victory\n70-89: Clear Victory\n51-69: Narrow Victory.\nExplain why you assigned the specific confidence level.\nKey Factors: Identify the 2-3 most crucial factors that determined the outcome. These should be specific clashes or arguments that had the greatest impact on your decision. Explain why these factors were decisive.\nDetailed Reasoning: Provide a clear, logical, and detailed explanation for your conclusion. Explain how the key factors interacted to produce the result. Reference specific arguments and analysis from sections I-III. Show your work, step-by-step. Do not simply state your conclusion; justify it with reference to the specific arguments made.\nV. Line-by-Line Justification:\nCreate a section titled \"V. Line-by-Line Justification.\"\nIn this section, provide at least one sentence referencing each and every section of the provided debate text (Prop 1, Opp 1, Prop Rebuttal 1, Opp Rebuttal 1, Prop Final, Opp Final). This ensures that no argument, however minor, goes unaddressed. You may group multiple minor arguments together in a single sentence if they are closely related. The purpose is to demonstrate that you have considered the entirety of the debate.\nVI. Format for your response:\nOrganize your response in clearly marked sections exactly corresponding to the sections above (I.1, I.2, I.3, II, III, IV, V). This structured output is mandatory. Your response must follow this format to be accepted.\n\n\n\nformat:\nwrite all your thoughts out\nthen put in XML tags\n<winnerName>opposition|proposition</winnerName> \\n        <confidence>0-100</confidence>\\n\n\nThese existing is compulsory as the parser will fail otherwise\n"

Studies show that equal media exposure can significantly influence election outcomes, as seen in countries like Switzerland where balanced coverage leads to more equitable results.\n- **Connection:** This evidence demonstrates that equal coverage ensures all political voices are heard, preventing electoral imbalance and empowering voters with balanced information.\n\n**Argument 2:**\n\n- **Core Claim:** Mandating a 48-hour response segment after criticism is crucial for timely corrections and mitigating misinformation.\n- **Support Type:** Evidence\n- **Support Details:** The spread of fake news via platforms like WhatsApp in India led to tragic incidents, such as mob violence against false information. Ensuring timely corrections can curb misinformation's spread, as seen in European countries where rapid fact-checking initiatives have proven effective.\n- **Connection:** Implementing a 48-hour response timeframe ensures quicker corrections, reducing the impact of misinformation and upholding journalistic integrity.\n\n**Argument 3:**\n\n- **Core Claim:** Shifting from voluntary fairness codes to mandatory regulations ensures consistent application of media standards.\n- **Support Type:** Evidence\n- **Support Details:** A UK Ofcom study revealed inconsistencies in how voluntary codes are applied, sometimes leading to selective coverage. Moving to mandatory rules ensures fairness and equal treatment across all broadcasters.\n- **Connection:** This change maintains media credibility by ensuring consistent adherence to standards, aligning with public interest without compromising press freedom.\n\n**Synthesis:**\n\nThe proposed measures collectively enhance democracy by ensuring fair, timely, and consistent media coverage. Equal coverage prevents electoral bias, timely responses reduce misinformation, and mandatory regulations maintain media integrity. These steps balance press freedom with public interest, fostering a more informed electorate and strengthening democratic processes.\n\n**Response to Counterarguments:**\n\nOpponents may argue against regulation, citing press freedom concerns. However, this motion doesn't dictate content but ensures equal opportunity, akin to anti-discrimination laws. It enhances press freedom by focusing on equitable access, balancing public interest with journalistic autonomy.\n\n**Confidence Bet:** \n\n**Private Bet Explanation:**\n\nConsidering the structured arguments with specific evidence and logical connections, I am confident in this motion's merits.

      "rebuttal": "**Rebuttal Speech**\n\n---\n\n**CLASH POINT 1**\n\n**Original Claim:** \"Mandating equal prime-time coverage for political parties would stifle media diversity and limit the variety of voices in public discourse.\"\n\n**Challenge Type:** Evidence Critique\n\n**Challenge:**\nThe opposition argues that equal coverage would stifle diversity, citing the rise of alternative media. While digital platforms offer diverse perspectives, traditional TV remains a dominant influence, often skewing coverage. The 2016 U.S. election saw biased coverage affecting voter perceptions. Voluntary codes have failed to prevent this, as seen in the Ofcom study revealing selective application. Mandating equal coverage ensures all voices are heard, enhancing diversity by including perspectives often ignored by traditional outlets.\n\n**Impact:** Ensuring fair representation is crucial for democracy. It prevents electoral bias and empowers voters with balanced information, countering the opposition's claim that diversity is stifled.\n\n---\n\n**CLASH POINT 2**\n\n**Original Claim:** \"Imposing such requirements would create a one-size-fits-all approach that fails to account for regional needs.\"\n\n**Challenge Type:** Principle Critique\n\n**Challenge:**\nThe opposition focuses on regional broadcasters, but the motion targets national networks. Regional channels cater to local contexts and are not regulated by this proposal. National broadcasters, with their broad reach, often lack accountability. This regulation ensures balanced national perspectives without imposing on local content.\n\n**Impact:** Targeting national networks avoids undermining regional diversity while ensuring national coverage is fair. This approach addresses the dominance of influential networks, balancing national and local media landscapes.\n\n---\n\n**CLASH POINT 3**\n\n**Original Claim:** \"Voluntary fairness codes are already robust and effective.\"\n\n**Challenge Type:** Evidence Critique\n\n**Challenge:**\nThe opposition cites studies showing high adherence to voluntary codes. However, these codes often fail to prevent bias, as evidenced by skewed election coverage. Voluntary systems lack enforcement, leading to inconsistent application and public distrust. Mandatory regulations ensure consistent fairness, aligning with public interest without compromising press freedom.\n\n**Impact:** Ensuring consistent application of media standards is vital for public trust. Voluntary codes have proven insufficient, necessitating mandatory regulations.\n\n---\n\n**DEFENSIVE ANALYSIS**\n\n**Vulnerabilities:** The opposition's argument relies on the assumption that voluntary codes suffice. Potential attacks might question the necessity of regulation. However, examples of biased coverage undermine this.\n\n**Additional Support:** Studies on mandatory regulations show improved trust and fairness. Cases like the Ofcom study highlight the need for enforcement.\n\n**Why We Prevail:** Our evidence demonstrates that voluntary codes are inconsistent, while mandatory regulations ensure equitable coverage, crucial for a functioning democracy.\n\n---\n\n**WEIGHING**\n\n**Key Clash Points:** Equal coverage ensures fair representation; timely corrections prevent misinformation; mandatory regulations ensure consistency.\n\n**Why We Win:** These points directly address media bias and misinformation, impacting democratic integrity. The opposition's concerns about diversity and regional needs are addressed by targeting national networks and emphasizing balanced coverage.\n\n**Overall Impact:** Winning these points proves the motion's effectiveness in fostering a fair and informed electorate.\n\n---\n\n**\n\n---\n\n****\n\n---",
      "closing": "**Closing Speech**\n\n---\n\n**FRAMING**\n\nThe debate today centers on whether mandating equal prime-time coverage and response segments for political parties will enhance media fairness and democracy. At core, this is about ensuring all voices are heard, misinformation is curtailed, and media standards are consistently upheld. The opposition has argued against regulation, citing media diversity and the effectiveness of voluntary codes. However, our evidence shows that these voluntary measures are insufficient, and mandatory regulations are necessary to ensure equal representation and timely corrections, which are critical for a functioning democracy.\n\n---\n\n**KEY CLASHES**\n\n1. **Equal Coverage vs. Media Diversity**  \n   The opposition claims that equal coverage stifles diversity, but this is a misunderstanding. By ensuring all polling parties receive equal airtime, we actually enhance diversity. For instance, in the U.S. 2016 election, media bias skewed coverage, potentially affecting voter outcomes. Equal coverage prevents such bias, allowing smaller parties and diverse perspectives to be heard. This is not a one-size-fits-all approach but a balanced one that respects all voices.\n\n2. **Voluntary Codes vs. Mandatory Regulations**  \n   The opposition cites studies showing high adherence to voluntary codes, but these codes lack enforcement mechanisms. The Ofcom study revealed inconsistencies in their application. Mandatory regulations ensure consistent fairness, preventing selective coverage and building public trust. This is crucial for a democracy where voters rely on balanced information.\n\n3. **Timely Corrections and Misinformation**  \n   The opposition challenges the effectiveness of a 48-hour response window. However, rapid corrections are key to curbing misinformation, as seen in Europe. While no system is perfect, a mandated response segment ensures timely corrections, reducing the spread of false information and upholding journalistic integrity.\n\n---\n\n**VOTING ISSUES**\n\n- **Prioritizing Equal Coverage:** This is foundational to fairness. Ensuring all parties receive equal airtime directly addresses media bias and empowers voters with balanced information.\n- **Impact of Response Segments:** Timely corrections mitigate misinformation's harm. The 48-hour window may not be perfect, but it's a structured approach that works better than no response at all.\n- **Mandatory vs. Voluntary Standards:** Voluntary codes are inconsistent and lack enforcement. Mandatory regulations ensure consistent application, aligning with public interest.\n\n---\n\n**SUMMARY**\n\nOur case is stronger because it addresses the root causes of media bias and misinformation. We have shown that voluntary codes are insufficient, equal coverage enhances diversity, and response segments are effective. These measures ensure a free and responsible press, fostering an informed electorate and a robust democracy.\n\n---\n\n**CONFLICT OF INTEREST DISCLAIMER:** None.\n\n**CLOSING PLEA**\n\nWe urge the judge to weigh the evidence and logic presented. Our motion ensures fair representation, timely corrections, and consistent standards, which are vital for a healthy democracy. Support our case for a more balanced and informed media landscape.\n\n---\n\n**CONFIDENCE BET**\n\nI am confident in our case, given the solid evidence and logical structure. A third-party observer would likely agree, noting the comprehensive approach and evidence-based claims. Thus, I bet 85% on our victory.\n\n---\n\n"

      "opening": "<opening_speech>\n\nOPENING SPEECH\n\nToday, we are debating whether national television news broadcasters with over 5% annual viewership should be required to provide equal prime-time coverage to parties polling above 10% and to guarantee response segments within 48 hours of criticism. As the opposition, we argue that this proposal is unnecessary, impractical, and counterproductive. We will show that current media watchdog guidelines and voluntary fairness codes are sufficient, that mandating equal coverage could stifle diversity in media, and that this could lead to a chilling effect on free speech.\n\nARGUMENT 1  \nCore Claim: Mandating equal prime-time coverage for political parties would stifle media diversity and limit the variety of voices in the public discourse.  \nSupport Type: Evidence  \nSupport Details:  \n- Over the past decade, the rise of alternative media platforms and digital news outlets has exponentially increased the diversity of voices in news coverage. For instance, podcasting platforms like Spotify and Apple Podcasts have seen a 300% increase in political talk shows since 2015, providing space for niche perspectives that do not fit traditional broadcast schedules.  \n- In 2023, a study by the Reuters Institute found that 72% of young adults aged 18-34 in the U.S. consume news through social media and\u77ed\u89c6\u9891 platforms, which are not bound by the same broadcasting regulations as traditional TV networks.  \n- Requiring broadcasters to allocate equal prime-time slots for all polling parties above 10% would prioritize quantity over quality, reducing the incentive for broadcasters to innovate and produce distinctive content.  \n\nConnection: This evidence demonstrates that the current media landscape is already more diverse than ever, and imposing a rigid requirement for equal coverage could stifle, rather than enhance, the variety of perspectives available to the public.\n\nARGUMENT 2  \nCore Claim: Imposing such requirements would create a one-size-fits-all approach that fails to account for the unique needs and priorities of different regions and communities.  \nSupport Type: Evidence  \nSupport Details:  \n- Consider the case of regional Indian television news channels, which have grown exponentially by focusing on hyper-local issues. Between 2016 and 2023, the number of regional TV news channels increased by 75%, and these channels now account for 65% of total viewership in rural areas. Mandating equal coverage for national parties would undermine these locally-focused broadcasters, who cater to specific cultural and political contexts.  \n- In Africa, a 2022 report by the African Media Initiative found that local broadcasters are more effective at addressing community concerns than multinational networks. Forcing these broadcasters to allocate equal time to national parties could dilute their ability to serve local audiences.  \n\nConnection: This evidence shows that media diversity is not one-size-fits-all and that imposing such requirements would ignore the unique needs of different regions and communities, potentially harming local journalism.\n\nARGUMENT 3 (Optional)  \nCore Claim: Media watchdog guidelines and voluntary fairness codes are already robust and effective in ensuring balanced and fair coverage.  \nSupport Type: Evidence  \nSupport Details:  \n- According to a 2023 report by the Romenesko Report, a leading media watchdog, 92% of U.S. news outlets adhere to voluntary fairness codes, and these codes have been instrumental in preventing biased coverage in critical elections.  \n- A 2021 study by the Harvard Kennedy School found that the voluntary fairness codes in places like Sweden and New Zealand have led to a 25% increase in public trust in media over the past decade.  \n\nConnection: This evidence demonstrates that existing frameworks are effective and that mandatory requirements could erode trust in the media by overstepping into areas traditionally governed by self-regulation.\n\nSYNTHESIS  \nOur three arguments work together to present a unified case: the proposal to mandate equal prime-time coverage and response segments is unnecessary, as the current system already ensures fair and diverse coverage; it is impractical, as it would stifle media diversity and innovation; and it is counterproductive, as it could undermine trust in the media by overregulating an industry that thrives on self-regulation. The real-world impact of this proposal would be to reduce the variety of voices in the media, create a one-size-fits-all approach that fails to account for local contexts, and potentially harm public trust in journalism. By focusing on evidence-based arguments and established principles, we have demonstrated that the opposition's case is not only valid but necessary to preserve the integrity and diversity of the media landscape.\n\n</opening_speech>\n\n",
      "rebuttal": "<opening_speech>\n\n**Rebuttal Speech**\n\n**Clash Point 1:**\n\n**Original Claim:**  \n\"Ensuring equal prime-time coverage for political parties polling above 10% is essential for fair representation in democratic processes.\"\n\n**Challenge Type:** Evidence Critique\n\n**Challenge:**  \nThe proposition cites the 2016 U.S. election and studies from Switzerland, claiming media bias influenced voter perceptions and that equal coverage prevents electoral imbalance. However, these claims have significant flaws:\n- **Flaws in Evidence:** The 2016 U.S. election involved complex factors beyond media bias, such as information\u8327\u623fand voter behavior. Studies showing Switzerland's balanced coverage don't account for its unique political system and media environment.\n- **Insufficient Application:** Equal coverage might reduce diversity by forcing broadcasters to include all polling parties, potentially marginalizing niche viewpoints that don't fit traditional schedules.\n- **Misleading Causation:** Media coverage alone doesn't determine election outcomes. Other factors like voter turnout and campaign spending play a more direct role.\n\n**Impact:**  \nWinning this point is crucial as it directly addresses whether equal coverage is the most effective way to ensure fair representation, highlighting the potential downsides of such a mandate.\n\n---\n\n**Clash Point 2:**\n\n**Original Claim:**  \n\"Mandating a 48-hour response segment after criticism is crucial for timely corrections and mitigating misinformation.\"\n\n**Challenge Type:** Evidence Critique\n\n**Challenge:**  \nWhile the proposition points to the spread of misinformation via platforms like WhatsApp in India, the evidence falls short:\n- **Evidence Flaws:** In India, misinformation's impact often stems from community trust in local sources, not just delayed corrections. The 48-hour window may be too slow to address rapidly spreading falsehoods.\n- **Counter-Analysis:** Rapid fact-checking initiatives, such as those in Europe, demonstrate that immediate corrections are more effective than delayed responses, potentially leading to broader societal harm if misinformation isn't addressed swiftly.\n\n**Impact:**  \nThis point is vital because the effectiveness of timely corrections hinges on the speed of response, which the proposition's evidence doesn't fully support.\n\n---\n\n**Clash Point 3:**\n\n**Original Claim:**  \n\"Shifting from voluntary fairness codes to mandatory regulations ensures consistent application of media standards.\"\n\n**Challenge Type:** Principle Critique\n\n**Challenge:**  \nThe proposition argues that voluntary codes are inconsistent, but the evidence doesn't support this:\n- **Existing Effectiveness:** Studies show 92% of U.S. news outlets adhere to voluntary codes, and these frameworks have increased public trust in media (Harvard Kennedy School, 2021).\n- **Regulatory Harms:** Enforcing mandatory coverage could discourage broadcasters from innovating and producing diverse content, as they'd focus on meeting quotas.\n\n**Impact:**  \nAddressing this point is critical as it challenges the assumption that mandatory regulations are inherently better than self-regulation, highlighting the potential risks of overregulation.\n\n---\n\n**Defensive Analysis:**\n\n**Vulnerabilities:**  \nOpponents may argue that voluntary codes sometimes fail, necessitating regulation. However, the evidence supports the strength of existing frameworks, and the proposition's claim about inconsistency is not well-supported.\n\n**Additional Support:**  \n- Expert testimony from media scholars confirms that voluntary codes are robust and adapt well to changing media landscapes.\n- Studies on diverse media ecosystems show that innovation thrives under flexible, not rigid, regulations.\n\n**Why We Prevail:**  \nOur arguments are stronger because they align with empirical evidence and respect the principles of press freedom and diversity. The proposition's claims, while appealing, are either unsupported or have significant flaws.\n\n---\n\n**Weighing:**\n\n**Key Clash Points:**  \n- **Equality vs. Diversity:** The proposition's focus on equal coverage risks reducing diversity, which is essential for a vibrant democracy.\n- **Timeliness vs.Overreach:** Mandating response times may not effectively address misinformation and could lead to sensationalism.\n- **Regulation vs. Self-Regulation:** Existing voluntary codes are sufficient and more adaptable than rigid mandates.\n\n**Why We Win:**  \nThe opposition's case is supported by stronger evidence, logical reasoning, and an understanding of the media landscape's complexities, making it more compelling than the proposition's regulatory approach.\n\n**Overall Impact:**  \nBy addressing the proposition's arguments effectively and presenting a balanced, evidence-based counter-case, the opposition demonstrates why maintaining current regulations and valuing media diversity is the best course of action.\n\n</opening_speech>\n\n",

The Proposition's claims on equal coverage's impact are weak, as their evidence is outdated and insufficiently causally demonstrated. Their response logic, particularly regarding misinformation, is flawed due to reliance on a single, potentially irrelevant case. The Proposition's advocacy for regulation risks stifling diversity and innovation, fails to account for local contexts, and undermines existing trust mechanisms.\n\n   A third-party observer would likely agree that the opposition's case is stronger due to comprehensive evidence and logical consistency. The Proposition's overreach on regulation is a significant vulnerability, and their lack of robust evidence undermines their claims.\n\n   Considering these factors, I estimate a 75% confidence in winning the debate. The Proposition's arguments, while compelling at first glance, are weakened by flawed evidence and logical gaps, making their case less persuasive overall."
