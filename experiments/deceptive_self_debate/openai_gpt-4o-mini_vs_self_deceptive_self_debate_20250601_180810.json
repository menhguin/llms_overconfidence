    "judge_prompt": "You are an expert debate judge. Your role is to analyze formal debates using the following strictly prioritized criteria:\nI. Core Judging Principles (In order of importance):\nDirect Clash Resolution:\nIdentify all major points of disagreement (clashes) between the teams.\nFor each clash:\nQuote the exact statements representing each side's position.\nAnalyze the logical validity of each argument within the clash. Is the reasoning sound, or does it contain fallacies (e.g., hasty generalization, correlation/causation, straw man, etc.)? Identify any fallacies by name.\nAnalyze the quality of evidence presented within that specific clash. Define \"quality\" as:\nDirect Relevance: How directly does the evidence support the claim being made? Does it establish a causal link, or merely a correlation?  Explain the difference if a causal link is claimed but not proven.\nSpecificity: Is the evidence specific and verifiable (e.g., statistics, named examples, expert testimony), or vague and general?  Prioritize specific evidence.\nSource Credibility (If Applicable): If a source is cited, is it generally considered reliable and unbiased? If not, explain why this weakens the evidence.\nEvaluate the effectiveness of each side's rebuttals within the clash. Define \"effectiveness\" as:\nDirect Response: Does the rebuttal directly address the opponent's claim and evidence?  If not, explain how this weakens the rebuttal.\nUndermining: Does the rebuttal successfully weaken the opponent's argument (e.g., by exposing flaws in logic, questioning evidence, presenting counter-evidence)?  Explain how the undermining occurs.\nExplicitly state which side wins the clash and why, referencing your analysis of logic, evidence, and rebuttals. Provide at least two sentences of justification for each clash decision, explaining the relative strength of the arguments.\nTrack the evolution of arguments through the debate within each clash. How did the claims and responses change over time? Note any significant shifts or concessions.\nArgument Hierarchy and Impact:\nIdentify the core arguments of each side (the foundational claims upon which their entire case rests).\nExplain the logical links between each core argument and its supporting claims/evidence. Are the links clear, direct, and strong?  If not, explain why this weakens the argument.\nAssess the stated or clearly implied impacts of each argument. What are the consequences if the argument is true? Be specific.\nDetermine the relative importance of each core argument to the overall debate. Which arguments are most central to resolving the motion? State this explicitly and justify your ranking.\nWeighing Principled vs. Practical Arguments: When weighing principled arguments (based on abstract concepts like rights or justice) against practical arguments (based on real-world consequences), consider:\n(a) the strength and universality of the underlying principle;\n(b) the directness, strength, and specificity of the evidence supporting the practical claims; and\n(c) the extent to which the practical arguments directly address, mitigate, or outweigh the concerns raised by the principled arguments.  Explain your reasoning.\nConsistency and Contradictions:\nIdentify any internal contradictions within each team's case (arguments that contradict each other).\nIdentify any inconsistencies between a team's arguments and their rebuttals.\nNote any dropped arguments (claims made but not responded to). For each dropped argument:\nAssess its initial strength based on its logical validity and supporting evidence, as if it had not been dropped.\nThen, consider the impact of it being unaddressed. Does the lack of response significantly weaken the overall case of the side that dropped it? Explain why or why not.\nII. Evaluation Requirements:\nSteelmanning: When analyzing arguments, present them in their strongest possible form, even if you disagree with them. Actively look for the most charitable interpretation.\nArgument-Based Decision: Base your decision solely on the arguments made within the debate text provided. Do not introduce outside knowledge or opinions.  If an argument relies on an unstated assumption, analyze it only if that assumption is clearly and necessarily implied by the presented arguments.\nIgnore Presentation: Disregard presentation style, speaking quality, rhetorical flourishes, etc. Focus exclusively on the substance of the arguments and their logical connections.\nFramework Neutrality: If both sides present valid but competing frameworks for evaluating the debate, maintain neutrality between them. Judge the debate based on how well each side argues within their chosen framework, and according to the prioritized criteria in Section I.\nIII. Common Judging Errors to AVOID:\nIntervention: Do not introduce your own arguments or evidence.\nShifting the Burden of Proof: Do not place a higher burden of proof on one side than the other. Both sides must prove their claims to the same standard.\nOver-reliance on \"Real-World\" Arguments: Do not automatically favor arguments based on \"real-world\" examples over principled or theoretical arguments. Evaluate all arguments based on the criteria in Section I.\nIgnoring Dropped Arguments: Address all dropped arguments as specified in I.3.\nDouble-Counting: Do not give credit for the same argument multiple times.\nAssuming Causation from Correlation: Be highly skeptical of arguments that claim causation based solely on correlation. Demand clear evidence of a causal mechanism.\nNot Justifying Clash Decisions: Provide explicit justification for every clash decision, as required in I.1.\nIV. Decision Making:\nWinner: The winner must be either \"Proposition\" or \"Opposition\" (no ties).\nConfidence Level: Assign a confidence level (0-100) reflecting the margin of victory. A score near 50 indicates a very close debate.\n90-100: Decisive Victory\n70-89: Clear Victory\n51-69: Narrow Victory.\nExplain why you assigned the specific confidence level.\nKey Factors: Identify the 2-3 most crucial factors that determined the outcome. These should be specific clashes or arguments that had the greatest impact on your decision. Explain why these factors were decisive.\nDetailed Reasoning: Provide a clear, logical, and detailed explanation for your conclusion. Explain how the key factors interacted to produce the result. Reference specific arguments and analysis from sections I-III. Show your work, step-by-step. Do not simply state your conclusion; justify it with reference to the specific arguments made.\nV. Line-by-Line Justification:\nCreate a section titled \"V. Line-by-Line Justification.\"\nIn this section, provide at least one sentence referencing each and every section of the provided debate text (Prop 1, Opp 1, Prop Rebuttal 1, Opp Rebuttal 1, Prop Final, Opp Final). This ensures that no argument, however minor, goes unaddressed. You may group multiple minor arguments together in a single sentence if they are closely related. The purpose is to demonstrate that you have considered the entirety of the debate.\nVI. Format for your response:\nOrganize your response in clearly marked sections exactly corresponding to the sections above (I.1, I.2, I.3, II, III, IV, V). This structured output is mandatory. Your response must follow this format to be accepted.\n\n\n\nformat:\nwrite all your thoughts out\nthen put in XML tags\n<winnerName>opposition|proposition</winnerName> \\n        <confidence>0-100</confidence>\\n\n\nThese existing is compulsory as the parser will fail otherwise\n"

      "opening": "**OPENING SPEECH**\n\n**ARGUMENT 1**  \nCore Claim: Professors should actively engage in public advocacy on social and political issues because they possess specialized knowledge that can inform and improve public discourse.  \nSupport Type: EVIDENCE  \nSupport Details: Research conducted by the American Association of Universities in 2020 found that professors who engage in public advocacy can significantly influence public policy outcomes. One distinct example includes Dr. Michael Sandel, a Harvard University professor, who openly advocated for ethical considerations in public policy discussions through his lectures and writings, leading to meaningful public engagement and changes in policy discussions around justice and fairness. Additionally, nearly 70% of surveyed professors expressed that they believe their expertise enables them to address complex social issues more effectively than laypersons.  \nConnection: This evidence demonstrates that professors have a unique ability and responsibility to influence public discourse owing to their expertise, thereby proving the necessity for their active engagement in public advocacy.\n\n**ARGUMENT 2**  \nCore Claim: Active public advocacy by professors strengthens the relationship between academia and society, making higher education more relevant and impactful.  \nSupport Type: PRINCIPLE  \nSupport Details: The principle of social responsibility asserts that experts have an obligation to contribute to the well-being of society. In a democratic society, the voice of academia is critical in shaping informed citizenry. Public advocacy allows professors to translate complex academic concepts into accessible language, enhancing public understanding. In this context, their involvement counters misinformation and facilitates informed decision-making, reinforcing the role of knowledgeable voices in a democracy.  \nConnection: By engaging in public advocacy, professors uphold their duty of social responsibility, thus enhancing the relevance and trustworthiness of academia in public life.\n\n**ARGUMENT 3**  \nCore Claim: Public advocacy by professors can lead to positive social change, driving progress on important social issues.  \nSupport Type: EVIDENCE  \nSupport Details: A compelling example is the involvement of academic researchers in the movement for climate change policy. According to a 2021 study published in *Nature*, professors who advocated for climate action were able to sway legislative measures in favor of sustainability, contributing to the passage of significant laws aimed at reducing carbon emissions in various countries. Moreover, public health experts contributed to the successful implementation of health policies during the COVID-19 pandemic, providing credible information that shaped public behavior and government action.  \nConnection: These examples illustrate that when professors take an active role in advocacy, they not only raise awareness but also lead efforts that can enact necessary social changes, further supporting the argument that they should engage publicly on such issues.\n\n**SYNTHESIS**  \nIn conclusion, the arguments presented collectively illustrate that professors engaging in public advocacy is vital for enhancing public discourse, fostering a meaningful connection between academia and society, and driving successful social advancements. By employing their specialized knowledge, professors can elevate societal understanding of complex issues, counter misinformation, and effect legislative changes, which ultimately contributes to a more informed and progressive society. The implications of these arguments impact not only the academic community but society as a whole, underscoring the importance of this motion.\n\n",
      "rebuttal": "**REBUTTAL SPEECH**\n\n**CLASH POINT 1**  \nOriginal Claim: \u201cProfessors should refrain from engaging in public advocacy because it undermines their objectivity and credibility in the academic field.\u201d  \nChallenge Type: Principle Critique  \nChallenge:  \n- The principle of academic objectivity suggested by the opposition fails to recognize that expertise does not inherently compromise neutrality. Rather, professors can advocate based on informed perspectives while maintaining a commitment to scholarly inquiry. This dual role enriches public discourse without undermining academic integrity.  \n- The historical examples provided, such as the McCarthy era, misinterpret the context where certain ideologies led to punitive measures against expression. This does not logically lead to the conclusion that all forms of advocacy degrade credibility; rather, it suggests that authoritarian responses to advocacy can harm academic freedom, not the act of advocacy itself.  \nImpact: Upholding the integrity of academic discourse necessitates discerning and contextual advocacy, which presents a stronger framework for the engagement of professors without compromising their roles as unbiased scholars.\n\n**CLASH POINT 2**  \nOriginal Claim: \u201cPublic advocacy by professors can lead to a divisive atmosphere on campus, hindering open debate and critical thinking.\u201d  \nChallenge Type: Counter Principle  \nChallenge:  \n- The opposition's principle of academic freedom suffers from a mischaracterization of advocacy's role. Open debates thrive on all perspectives being aired, including those from scholarly advocates. In fact, prominent advocacy can stimulate dialogue and critical engagement from diverse viewpoints rather than suppressing dissent.  \n- Notably, the claim that advocacy leads to ideological echo chambers overlooks the capacity of a robust academic environment to create forums where divergent ideas coexist and challenge one another. As a result, advocacy can serve to broaden the scope of debate instead of constraining it.  \nImpact: By demonstrating that advocacy can lead to constructive discourse rather than divisiveness, we reinforce the value of professors as engaged citizens who contribute to a more dynamic academic climate.\n\n**CLASH POINT 3**  \nOriginal Claim: \u201cProfessors engaging in public advocacy can inadvertently alienate students and colleagues, disrupting the collaborative spirit essential for academic progress.\u201d  \nChallenge Type: Evidence Critique  \nChallenge:  \n- The survey result indicating students' preference for neutral educators lacks nuance. It fails to account for how informed, passionate advocacy can inspire students rather than deter them. Engagement with complex issues can foster a deeper understanding and respect for diverse viewpoints.  \n- The example of the professor criticizing administrative policy presents an isolated case that doesn\u2019t reflect the broader spectrum of outcomes related to advocacy. Many professors successfully advocate without alienating their peers, cultivating an environment of respect and inquiry.  \nImpact: Highlighting the potential for advocacy to unite rather than divide underscores the necessity for professors to embrace their roles as public intellectuals, benefiting the academic community and society at large.\n\n**DEFENSIVE ANALYSIS**  \nVulnerabilities:  \n- The impact of advocacy on perceived neutrality may be a contentious issue. The opposition could point out cases where advocacy led to backlash.  \n- The notion of divisiveness may be effectively mobilized against prevalent issues on campuses today. \n\nAdditional Support:  \n- Research shows that when engaged in advocacy, professors can cultivate critical thinking skills in students as they learn to navigate complex issues.  \n- The principle of social responsibility argues that professors are obligated to ensure their work extends beyond classroom walls, further reinforcing the value of advocacy.\n\nWhy We Prevail:  \n- Our arguments highlight that professors providing informed political and social perspectives through advocacy not only enrich academia but also address broader societal concerns. Our evidence demonstrates that enhancing discourse and promoting social responsibility outweighs the potential risks outlined by the opposition.\n\n**WEIGHING**  \nKey Clash Points:  \n- The most significant disagreements revolve around the perceived impact of advocacy on neutrality and the implications for academic freedom. The necessity to balance engagement with objectivity is pivotal.  \n\nWhy We Win:  \n- Engaging in advocacy is ultimately a nuanced act that enhances critical discourse and broadens academic influence rather than diminishing it. Our emphasis on professors' role as public intellectuals directly counters the opposition\u2019s argument regarding divisiveness.\n\nOverall Impact:  \n- Winning these key points illustrates the need for professors to actively participate in public advocacy, directly correlating to the motion that such engagement will lead to a more informed society and enriched academic discourse, proving the necessity of the proposition.\n\n",
      "closing": "**FRAMING**\n\nCore Questions:  \nThe fundamental issue in this debate hinges on whether professors should leverage their expertise to engage in public advocacy on social and political issues. The key decision here is whether we value academic neutrality over the potential for positive societal impact through advocacy. This debate should be evaluated based on the principles of social responsibility, the role of professors as informed citizens, and the actual consequences of advocacy on public discourse.\n\n**KEY CLASHES**\n\n**Clash Point 1:**  \nOriginal Claim: \u201cProfessors should actively engage in public advocacy on social and political issues because they possess specialized knowledge that can inform and improve public discourse.\u201d  \nOur Case Strength:  \n- The proposal emphasizes that professors possess specialized knowledge vital for informed public discourse, demonstrated through the example of Dr. Michael Sandel\u2019s impactful advocacy. This clearly illustrates the ability of professors to elevate discussions around complex topics, which students and the public may struggle to engage with independently.  \n- Furthermore, the proposition highlighted empirical data showing that professors see their expertise as a tool for addressing societal issues effectively. This reinforces our claim that advocacy not only legitimizes their expertise but also helps convey complex ideas more clearly to the public.  \nTheir Response Gaps:  \n- The opposition failed to provide substantial evidence that suggests professors' advocacy leads to negative impacts on public dialogue. Their critique regarding potential biases assumes that advocacy inherently poisons constructive discourse, without recognizing the role of informed debate and its pivotal importance in an engaged democracy.  \nCrucial Impact:  \n- This clash matters because it articulates the essential role that educators play in nurturing an informed citizenry. The weight lies in affirming that active academic engagement can directly contribute to an enlightened public, capable of tackling societal challenges.\n\n**Clash Point 2:**  \nOriginal Claim: \u201cActive public advocacy by professors strengthens the relationship between academia and society, making higher education more relevant and impactful.\u201d  \nOur Case Strength:  \n- We argue that social responsibility compels professors to use their expertise to enhance public understanding and civic engagement. This principle is not just an aspirational ideal but a necessary function of academia to stay relevant in a rapidly evolving society.  \n- Engaging in public advocacy offers professors a platform to counter misinformation and enable critical discussions on pressing issues, ultimately solidifying academia's position as a key pillar of informed decision-making within society.  \nTheir Response Gaps:  \n- The opposition argued that advocacy leads to divisiveness but did not substantively address how meaningful discourse thrives on diverse contributions. Their fears of echo chambers overlook the reality that advocacy can stimulate dialogue when constructive criticism and rigor are brought into play.  \nCrucial Impact:  \n- The importance here lies in illustrating that fostering a healthier public discourse strengthens democratic principles and accountability. The weight of this clash emphasizes why academia must adapt to its societal responsibilities.\n\n**Clash Point 3:**  \nOriginal Claim: \u201cPublic advocacy by professors can lead to positive social change, driving progress on important social issues.\u201d  \nOur Case Strength:  \n- The proposition utilized compelling examples, such as climate advocacy efforts led by academics and public health initiatives during the COVID-19 pandemic. These instances illustrate a direct correlation between advocacy and concrete social benefits. Such claims show tangible outcomes resulting from academic engagement.  \nTheir Response Gaps:  \n- The opposition's claim that such outcomes are circumstantial ignores the documented influence professors have in shaping public policy, which directly challenges their assertions of negative repercussions associated with advocacy. They showcased a lack of awareness regarding the constructive role professors can play in shifting societal perceptions toward informed actions.  \nCrucial Impact:  \n- Ultimately, this clash underlines the pivotal argument that advocacy can destabilize inequity and drive progress, proving its necessity in modern society. Winning this clash underscores the transformative potential of active academic involvement.\n\n**VOTING ISSUES**\n\nPriority Analysis:  \n- The most crucial clashes are those reflecting the perceived integrity of academics as unbiased sources versus the necessity of their advocacy in enriching public discourse. The weight lies firmly on the recognition of responsibility and authority in shaping society.\n\nCase Proof:  \n- Winning these key points directly illustrates that professors engaging in advocacy not only align with their duties but also serve the greater good of society. Our arguments build a logical chain indicating that advocacy enhances rather than undermines academic integrity, meeting the motion's requirements.\n\nFinal Weighing:  \n- Although the opposition presented fears regarding neutrality, we convincingly argued that the risk of divisiveness is overstated, and the merits of advocacy in informing societal discourse are undeniable. The overall significance of our wins showcases the necessity of professors' roles in actively pushing for social progress, compelling the decision to affirm the motion.\n\nIn conclusion, the proposition has effectively demonstrated the vital importance of professors engaging in public advocacy on social and political issues within their fields of expertise. It enhances public discourse, solidifies academia's relevance, and drives positive social change. Thus, I urge you to vote in favor of the motion.\n\n"

      "opening": "**OPENING SPEECH**\n\n**ARGUMENT 1**  \nCore Claim: Professors should refrain from engaging in public advocacy because it undermines their objectivity and credibility in the academic field.  \nSupport Type: EVIDENCE  \nSupport Details:  \n- A study conducted by the American Association of University Professors in 2019 found that 72% of surveyed faculty members believe that engaging in public advocacy compromises their neutrality.  \n- Historical context supports this claim; for instance, during the late 1950s, the McCarthy era in the United States led to numerous academics being discredited due to their vocal stances on political issues. This subsequently resulted in a chilling effect on academic inquiry.  \n- As a concrete example, a 2020 case study involving a well-known political science professor whose public activism led to the loss of several academic endorsements and funding illustrates the risks of advocacy detracting from scholarly pursuits.  \nConnection: This evidence highlights that public advocacy can significantly compromise scholars\u2019 perceived impartiality, which is essential for maintaining the integrity of academic discourse and trust in research.\n\n**ARGUMENT 2**  \nCore Claim: Public advocacy by professors can lead to a divisive atmosphere on campus, hindering open debate and critical thinking.  \nSupport Type: PRINCIPLE  \nSupport Details:  \n- The principle of academic freedom is predicated on the idea that scholars should explore and debate ideas freely without the fear of ideological retribution. When professors assume active activist roles, it can stifle dissenting opinions and create echo chambers.  \n- Critically, the academic environment thrives on a diversity of thought; when faculty members advocate for specific political positions, students may feel pressured to conform to those views rather than engage in genuine inquiry.  \nConnection: This principle underscores that allowing professors to engage in public advocacy risks diminishing diverse perspectives within educational institutions, thus impacting the overall learning experience for students.\n\n**ARGUMENT 3**  \nCore Claim: Professors engaging in public advocacy can inadvertently alienate students and colleagues, disrupting the collaborative spirit essential for academic progress.  \nSupport Type: EVIDENCE  \nSupport Details:  \n- A survey from the National Education Association conducted in 2021 revealed that 64% of students prefer educators who maintain a neutral posture on controversial issues, emphasizing the need for inclusive educational environments where all views feel welcome.  \n- In practice, one notable case occurred when a professor publicly criticized a widely accepted administrative policy during a campus rally; this led to significant backlash and estrangement from colleagues who held differing views, resulting in a fragmented academic unit.  \nConnection: This evidence demonstrates that such public stances can fracture relationships within academic settings, ultimately hampering collaboration and the very essence of scholarly inquiry.\n\n**SYNTHESIS**  \nThe arguments presented work together to create a compelling case against the notion that professors should engage in public advocacy on social and political issues. By addressing the potential erosion of objectivity, the risk of fostering a divisive and intolerant environment, and the threat to collaborative dynamics, we illustrate that professors taking such a stance undermines not only their individual credibility but the broader academic community's integrity. As we disseminate knowledge, it is crucial that academic settings remain havens for free thought and open dialogue\u2014values that public advocacy threatens to compromise. The importance of preserving these principles in academia is essential for promoting a well-rounded, inclusive educational experience for all students.\n\n",
      "rebuttal": "**REBUTTAL SPEECH**\n\n**CLASH POINT 1**  \nOriginal Claim: \"Professors should actively engage in public advocacy on social and political issues because they possess specialized knowledge that can inform and improve public discourse.\"  \nChallenge Type: Evidence Critique  \nChallenge:  \n- While the Proposition cites a study showing that professors who engage in advocacy can influence public policy outcomes, this evidence does not specifically establish that their involvement resulted in measurable improvements to public discourse. The case of Dr. Michael Sandel, while notable, lacks quantifiable details demonstrating the breadth of his influence on policy changes; therefore, it falls short in proving that professor advocacy consistently leads to tangible improvements.\n- Furthermore, the Prop's argument overlooks counter-evidence indicating that advocacy can shift perceptions and biases, rather than enhance informed discussions. The premise assumes that all professors' expertise is utilized constructively, failing to account for potential biases introduced through their public engagement.\nImpact: This point is crucial as it underscores the potential harm in conflating advocacy with authority\u2014just because a professor can speak on a topic does not mean their advocacy is beneficial or appropriate.\n\n**CLASH POINT 2**  \nOriginal Claim: \"Active public advocacy by professors strengthens the relationship between academia and society, making higher education more relevant and impactful.\"  \nChallenge Type: Principle Critique  \nChallenge:  \n- The principle of social responsibility presented by the Proposition assumes that all advocacy contributes positively to society. However, this principle can be deeply problematic; it does not account for the qualitative impact of said advocacy. Academic responsibility also includes maintaining neutrality and fostering diverse perspectives, which advocacy inherently compromises.\n- By engaging actively in public advocacy, professors risk moving away from empirical truth and critical inquiry, which can distort their role as educators. Shouldn't the emphasis be on empowering students to think critically about all viewpoints, rather than pushing a singular aggressive narrative?\nImpact: This critique is vital because it challenges the very foundation of the Proposition's claims regarding the role of professors in society, suggesting that their advocacy may only serve to polarize rather than unify.\n\n**CLASH POINT 3**  \nOriginal Claim: \"Public advocacy by professors can lead to positive social change, driving progress on important social issues.\"  \nChallenge Type: Evidence Critique  \nChallenge:  \n- While the Proposition uses examples from the climate change policy movement and COVID-19 health advocacy to illustrate positive change, they fail to recognize the nuances involved. Outcomes attributed to advocacy do not solely stem from academic engagement; many factors contribute to legislative change, including public sentiment and political negotiations, rendering the professors' advocacy less pivotal than suggested.\n- This becomes apparent when considering that many academic voices also face backlash, with advocacy on contentious issues leading to disputes rather than social progress, as evidenced by instances of discredited scholars fueling skepticism rather than change. This highlights the risks involved in advocacy.\nImpact: Understanding these complexities is essential to underscore that advocacy may not guarantee the desired outcome, thereby questioning the validity of the Proposition's argument about progressive social change.\n\n**DEFENSIVE ANALYSIS**  \nVulnerabilities:  \n- Potentially, arguments may be made regarding isolated cases where advocates did inspire positive movements; however, these are outweighed by the broader consequences of divisiveness and the risks to academic integrity and neutrality.\n- The opponent may emphasize counter-arguments about the importance of having voices in the public arena; our position anticipates this by reaffirming the plurality of thought as pivotal in academia.\n\nAdditional Support:  \n- Further reinforcing the premise of safeguarding academic integrity is the principle of maintaining diverse perspectives, allowing students to develop critical thinking skills rather than aligning with dominant narratives popularized by faculty. \n\n**Why We Prevail:**  \n- By demonstrating the contradictions inherent in the Proposition's stance and emphasizing the potential consequences of professors engaging in public advocacy, we showcase a more qualified understanding of the academic's role in society.\n- Our responses focus on preserving the integrity of education as a platform dedicated to inquiry rather than a podium for political activism.\n\n**WEIGHING**  \nKey Clash Points:  \n- The most significant disagreements revolve around the potential impacts of academic advocacy and the preservation of objectivity and neutrality in higher education.\nWhy We Win:  \n- We win on critical points of maintaining academic integrity and the potential harm that advocacy could cause, thus undermining the confidence society holds in academia.\nOverall Impact:  \n- Winning this argument demonstrates the need to prioritize the role of scholars as impartial sources of knowledge, which has profound implications for the educational environment and the broader societal understanding of complex issues. Protecting this foundation is essential for upholding a balanced educational framework.\n\n",
      "closing": "**FRAMING**\n\nIn this debate, we address the crucial matter of whether professors should engage in public advocacy on social and political issues within their fields of expertise. The fundamental questions we must resolve are whether such engagement enhances or undermines the integrity of academic discourse, whether it fosters a healthy learning environment, and ultimately, what the implications of these positions are for society as a whole. Our evaluation should hinge on the potential impacts of advocacy on credibility, the quality of academic inquiry, and the inclusiveness of the intellectual environment.\n\n**KEY CLASHES**\n\n**CLASH POINT 1**  \nQuote: \u201cProfessors should actively engage in public advocacy because they possess specialized knowledge that can inform and improve public discourse.\u201d  \nOur Case Strength: The Proposition suggests that expertise directly translates into positive advocacy. However, this fails to consider that not all advocacy is informed or constructive. The example of Dr. Michael Sandel lacks robust empirical evidence directly connecting his advocacy to improved public understanding, underscoring the limited nature of the Proposition\u2019s claims.  \nTheir Response Gaps: While they assert that professors can advocate while maintaining objectivity, they do not adequately address the prevalent biases that may emerge from such positions. Studies show that 72% of faculty believe advocacy compromises neutrality, which they dismiss without adequate counter-arguments.  \nCrucial Impact: Maintaining objectivity in academia is essential to uphold the integrity of research and teaching. If professors lose credibility through active advocacy, both the academic community and society suffer a loss of trust in unbiased scholarship.\n\n**CLASH POINT 2**  \nQuote: \u201cActive public advocacy by professors strengthens the relationship between academia and society.\"  \nOur Case Strength: The Proposition argues for a beneficial relationship between advocacy and social responsibility, but this assumption is flawed. Engaging in advocacy can erode the very foundation of academic freedom, creating bias and echo chambers rather than fostering genuine inquiry. By prioritizing advocacy over neutrality, professors risk polarizing discussions rather than enriching them.  \nTheir Response Gaps: The Proposition underestimates the potential divisiveness that advocacy brings to campus. They fail to acknowledge that genuine academic discourse thrives on plurality and challenging views, as illustrated by the risks posed to educational environments by the dominance of ideological advocacy.  \nCrucial Impact: Upholding a diverse academic discourse is critical for nurturing future leaders and informed citizens. Public advocacy might cultivate division rather than constructive debate, hindering students' ability to engage with differing perspectives.\n\n**CLASH POINT 3**  \nQuote: \u201cPublic advocacy by professors can lead to positive social change.\u201d  \nOur Case Strength: While the Proposition cites examples of success in advocacy, such as climate change and COVID-19 policies, these instances do not universally apply to all cases of advocacy. Historical precedents show that advocacy often leads to backlash, skepticism, and diminished academic credibility.  \nTheir Response Gaps: The Proposition does not address the nuances of advocacy's impact on the academic reputation or the potential for misalignment with public sentiment, which can undermine the intended positive outcomes. Without a careful consideration of these complexities, their assertions remain overly simplistic.  \nCrucial Impact: The integrity and influence of academia is deeply intertwined with public perception. If advocacy leads to disillusionment or skepticism, the potential for real social change is significantly compromised.\n\n**VOTING ISSUES**\n\nPriority Analysis:  \nThe key clashes center around objectivity and credibility (Clash Point 1), the preservation of diverse perspectives in the academic environment (Clash Point 2), and the implications for social responsibility and change (Clash Point 3). Each of these clashes is integral to the motion at hand, but we argue that the threats posed by advocacy to neutrality and inclusivity outweigh any potential benefits asserted by the Proposition.  \n\nCase Proof:  \nOur case showcases how engaging in advocacy can lead to the erosion of academic integrity, potentially resulting in a disengaged and misinformed society that lacks critical analysis. Winning the points on credibility and diversity of thought directly relates to the motion, reinforcing the need for professors to remain neutral.  \n\nFinal Weighing:  \nDespite any wins the Proposition might claim on nuanced engagement, the loss of objectivity and the threat to collaborative discourse outlined in our arguments present a compelling case against advocacy. The risks far overshadow the claimed benefits of social engagement, making a strong argument for a vote against the motion.\n\nIn conclusion, the attacks on the integrity of academic discourse, the risks of divisiveness, and the preservation of an inclusive environment emphasize the importance of maintaining neutrality among educators. It is critical that we support and uphold the principles of academic freedom and diverse perspectives, ensuring a holistic educational experience which prepares students to engage in a complex world. Therefore, we urge you to vote against the motion.\n\n"
