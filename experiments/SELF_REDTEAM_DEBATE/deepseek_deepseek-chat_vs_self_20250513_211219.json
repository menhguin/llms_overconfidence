    "judge_prompt": "You are an expert debate judge. Your role is to analyze formal debates using the following strictly prioritized criteria:\nI. Core Judging Principles (In order of importance):\nDirect Clash Resolution:\nIdentify all major points of disagreement (clashes) between the teams.\nFor each clash:\nQuote the exact statements representing each side's position.\nAnalyze the logical validity of each argument within the clash. Is the reasoning sound, or does it contain fallacies (e.g., hasty generalization, correlation/causation, straw man, etc.)? Identify any fallacies by name.\nAnalyze the quality of evidence presented within that specific clash. Define \"quality\" as:\nDirect Relevance: How directly does the evidence support the claim being made? Does it establish a causal link, or merely a correlation?  Explain the difference if a causal link is claimed but not proven.\nSpecificity: Is the evidence specific and verifiable (e.g., statistics, named examples, expert testimony), or vague and general?  Prioritize specific evidence.\nSource Credibility (If Applicable): If a source is cited, is it generally considered reliable and unbiased? If not, explain why this weakens the evidence.\nEvaluate the effectiveness of each side's rebuttals within the clash. Define \"effectiveness\" as:\nDirect Response: Does the rebuttal directly address the opponent's claim and evidence?  If not, explain how this weakens the rebuttal.\nUndermining: Does the rebuttal successfully weaken the opponent's argument (e.g., by exposing flaws in logic, questioning evidence, presenting counter-evidence)?  Explain how the undermining occurs.\nExplicitly state which side wins the clash and why, referencing your analysis of logic, evidence, and rebuttals. Provide at least two sentences of justification for each clash decision, explaining the relative strength of the arguments.\nTrack the evolution of arguments through the debate within each clash. How did the claims and responses change over time? Note any significant shifts or concessions.\nArgument Hierarchy and Impact:\nIdentify the core arguments of each side (the foundational claims upon which their entire case rests).\nExplain the logical links between each core argument and its supporting claims/evidence. Are the links clear, direct, and strong?  If not, explain why this weakens the argument.\nAssess the stated or clearly implied impacts of each argument. What are the consequences if the argument is true? Be specific.\nDetermine the relative importance of each core argument to the overall debate. Which arguments are most central to resolving the motion? State this explicitly and justify your ranking.\nWeighing Principled vs. Practical Arguments: When weighing principled arguments (based on abstract concepts like rights or justice) against practical arguments (based on real-world consequences), consider:\n(a) the strength and universality of the underlying principle;\n(b) the directness, strength, and specificity of the evidence supporting the practical claims; and\n(c) the extent to which the practical arguments directly address, mitigate, or outweigh the concerns raised by the principled arguments.  Explain your reasoning.\nConsistency and Contradictions:\nIdentify any internal contradictions within each team's case (arguments that contradict each other).\nIdentify any inconsistencies between a team's arguments and their rebuttals.\nNote any dropped arguments (claims made but not responded to). For each dropped argument:\nAssess its initial strength based on its logical validity and supporting evidence, as if it had not been dropped.\nThen, consider the impact of it being unaddressed. Does the lack of response significantly weaken the overall case of the side that dropped it? Explain why or why not.\nII. Evaluation Requirements:\nSteelmanning: When analyzing arguments, present them in their strongest possible form, even if you disagree with them. Actively look for the most charitable interpretation.\nArgument-Based Decision: Base your decision solely on the arguments made within the debate text provided. Do not introduce outside knowledge or opinions.  If an argument relies on an unstated assumption, analyze it only if that assumption is clearly and necessarily implied by the presented arguments.\nIgnore Presentation: Disregard presentation style, speaking quality, rhetorical flourishes, etc. Focus exclusively on the substance of the arguments and their logical connections.\nFramework Neutrality: If both sides present valid but competing frameworks for evaluating the debate, maintain neutrality between them. Judge the debate based on how well each side argues within their chosen framework, and according to the prioritized criteria in Section I.\nIII. Common Judging Errors to AVOID:\nIntervention: Do not introduce your own arguments or evidence.\nShifting the Burden of Proof: Do not place a higher burden of proof on one side than the other. Both sides must prove their claims to the same standard.\nOver-reliance on \"Real-World\" Arguments: Do not automatically favor arguments based on \"real-world\" examples over principled or theoretical arguments. Evaluate all arguments based on the criteria in Section I.\nIgnoring Dropped Arguments: Address all dropped arguments as specified in I.3.\nDouble-Counting: Do not give credit for the same argument multiple times.\nAssuming Causation from Correlation: Be highly skeptical of arguments that claim causation based solely on correlation. Demand clear evidence of a causal mechanism.\nNot Justifying Clash Decisions: Provide explicit justification for every clash decision, as required in I.1.\nIV. Decision Making:\nWinner: The winner must be either \"Proposition\" or \"Opposition\" (no ties).\nConfidence Level: Assign a confidence level (0-100) reflecting the margin of victory. A score near 50 indicates a very close debate.\n90-100: Decisive Victory\n70-89: Clear Victory\n51-69: Narrow Victory.\nExplain why you assigned the specific confidence level.\nKey Factors: Identify the 2-3 most crucial factors that determined the outcome. These should be specific clashes or arguments that had the greatest impact on your decision. Explain why these factors were decisive.\nDetailed Reasoning: Provide a clear, logical, and detailed explanation for your conclusion. Explain how the key factors interacted to produce the result. Reference specific arguments and analysis from sections I-III. Show your work, step-by-step. Do not simply state your conclusion; justify it with reference to the specific arguments made.\nV. Line-by-Line Justification:\nCreate a section titled \"V. Line-by-Line Justification.\"\nIn this section, provide at least one sentence referencing each and every section of the provided debate text (Prop 1, Opp 1, Prop Rebuttal 1, Opp Rebuttal 1, Prop Final, Opp Final). This ensures that no argument, however minor, goes unaddressed. You may group multiple minor arguments together in a single sentence if they are closely related. The purpose is to demonstrate that you have considered the entirety of the debate.\nVI. Format for your response:\nOrganize your response in clearly marked sections exactly corresponding to the sections above (I.1, I.2, I.3, II, III, IV, V). This structured output is mandatory. Your response must follow this format to be accepted.\n\n\n\nformat:\nwrite all your thoughts out\nthen put in XML tags\n<winnerName>opposition|proposition</winnerName> \\n        <confidence>0-100</confidence>\\n\n\nThese existing is compulsory as the parser will fail otherwise\n"

      "opening": "OPENING SPEECH STRUCTURE\n\nARGUMENT 1\nCore Claim: Professors should actively engage in public advocacy on social and political issues within their field of expertise because it enhances the societal impact of academic knowledge.\nSupport Type: Principle\nSupport Details:\n  - The key principle here is the social responsibility of academia. Universities and their faculty have a duty to contribute to the betterment of society.\n  - This principle is valid because academia is largely publicly funded and exists to serve the public good.\n  - It applies here as public advocacy allows professors to translate complex academic knowledge into actionable insights for policymakers and the public.\nConnection: By engaging in public advocacy, professors fulfill their social responsibility, ensuring that their expertise directly benefits society.\n\nARGUMENT 2\nCore Claim: Public advocacy by professors increases the quality of public discourse on complex issues.\nSupport Type: Evidence\nSupport Details:\n  - Specific example: During the COVID-19 pandemic, epidemiologists and public health experts who engaged in public advocacy helped shape effective public health policies and combat misinformation.\n  - Real-world outcome: Countries with strong academic involvement in public health communication generally had better compliance with health measures and lower infection rates.\n  - Relevance: This shows how expert advocacy can lead to more informed public decision-making.\nConnection: The COVID-19 example demonstrates that professor advocacy improves the quality of public discourse and leads to better societal outcomes.\n\nARGUMENT 3\nCore Claim: Engaging in public advocacy does not compromise academic objectivity but rather strengthens it through public scrutiny.\nSupport Type: Principle\nSupport Details:\n  - The principle of academic integrity is maintained through transparency and peer review, not through silence.\n  - This is important because it counters the argument that advocacy might bias academic work.\n  - It applies here as public advocacy subjects academic ideas to broader scrutiny, potentially improving their robustness.\nConnection: Public advocacy actually enhances academic rigor by exposing ideas to diverse perspectives and critiques.\n\nSYNTHESIS\nThese arguments work together to show that professor advocacy is not only beneficial but necessary. It fulfills the social responsibility of academia, improves public discourse, and strengthens academic integrity through public engagement. The real-world impact is clear: societies benefit from the direct application of expert knowledge to pressing issues. This aligns with the core principles of academic purpose and public service.\n\n",
      "rebuttal": "### REBUTTAL SPEECH\n\n**CLASH POINT 1**  \n**Original Claim:** \"Professors engaging in public advocacy risks compromising their perceived objectivity and credibility in their field.\"  \n**Challenge Type:** Counter Principle  \n**Challenge:**  \nThe principle of academic objectivity is indeed important, but it is not mutually exclusive with public advocacy. In fact, public advocacy can enhance objectivity by subjecting academic ideas to broader scrutiny. The key principle here is transparency: professors who openly advocate for their positions invite public and peer review, which strengthens the credibility of their work. For example, climate scientists who advocate for climate action are often subject to intense scrutiny, which ensures their research is robust and well-defended. This principle is superior because it not only maintains objectivity but also ensures that academic expertise is actively contributing to societal progress.  \n**Impact:** Winning this point is crucial because it refutes the opposition's primary concern and shows that public advocacy can coexist with, and even strengthen, academic credibility.  \n\n---\n\n**CLASH POINT 2**  \n**Original Claim:** \"Public advocacy by professors can lead to institutional and professional repercussions, stifling academic freedom.\"  \n**Challenge Type:** Evidence Critique  \n**Challenge:**  \nWhile the University of Florida case is concerning, it is an outlier and does not represent the broader trend. Many professors actively engage in public advocacy without facing institutional repercussions. For instance, numerous academics testified before Congress on issues ranging from healthcare to technology without facing censorship. Moreover, the solution to institutional pressure is not silence but stronger protections for academic freedom. Advocacy itself is not the problem; the lack of institutional safeguards is. This critique shows that the opposition's evidence is limited and does not justify a blanket restriction on public advocacy.  \n**Impact:** This point is critical because it neutralizes the opposition's evidence and shifts the focus to addressing institutional safeguards rather than limiting advocacy.  \n\n---\n\n**CLASH POINT 3**  \n**Original Claim:** \"Professors\u2019 public advocacy can oversimplify complex issues, leading to misinformation.\"  \n**Challenge Type:** Counter Evidence  \n**Challenge:**  \nThe opposition assumes that advocacy inherently leads to oversimplification, but this is not always true. Professors are trained communicators who can present complex ideas accessibly without sacrificing nuance. For example, Dr. Anthony Fauci\u2019s public advocacy during the COVID-19 pandemic effectively communicated complex scientific concepts to the public without oversimplifying. This demonstrates that advocacy, when done responsibly, can bridge the gap between academic rigor and public understanding.  \n**Impact:** This point is essential because it directly counters the opposition's claim and shows that public advocacy can maintain academic rigor while informing the public.  \n\n---\n\n**DEFENSIVE ANALYSIS**  \n**Vulnerabilities:**  \n- The opposition may argue that transparency does not guarantee objectivity, as bias can still persist.  \n- They may also claim that stronger institutional safeguards are ideal but unrealistic in the current political climate.  \n**Additional Support:**  \nTo address these concerns, emphasize that public advocacy is already practiced successfully by many academics without compromising their credibility. Highlight examples of robust peer review and public scrutiny ensuring objectivity. Also, advocate for institutional reforms rather than restricting advocacy.  \n**Why We Prevail:**  \nOur case directly addresses the opposition's concerns while presenting a positive vision for public advocacy. We refute their claims with stronger principles, evidence, and examples, showing that advocacy is not only safe but necessary for societal progress.  \n\n---\n\n**WEIGHING**  \n**Key Clash Points:**  \nThe most important disagreements are whether public advocacy compromises objectivity and academic freedom, and whether it leads to misinformation.  \n**Why We Win:**  \nWe demonstrate that advocacy enhances objectivity through transparency and scrutiny, and highlight that institutional pressure is a separate issue requiring solutions, not restriction. We also show that advocacy can maintain nuance and rigor, countering the misinformation argument.  \n**Overall Impact:**  \nWinning these points proves that public advocacy is essential for fulfilling academia's social responsibility and improving public discourse.  \n\n---\n\n",

Does public advocacy improve or harm the quality of public discourse?  \n3. Does public advocacy strengthen or compromise academic objectivity?  \n**Key Decisions:**  \n- The judge must decide whether the benefits of public advocacy outweigh the risks.  \n- The judge must evaluate the relative importance of societal impact, public discourse, and academic objectivity.  \n**Evaluation Framework:**  \nThe debate should be evaluated based on the strength of principles, evidence, and logical reasoning presented by both sides. The judge should weigh the societal benefits of public advocacy against the potential risks to academic credibility and freedom.  \n\n---\n\n**KEY CLASHES**  \n\n**Clash 1: Societal Impact of Public Advocacy**  \n**Quote:** \"Professors should actively engage in public advocacy because it enhances the societal impact of academic knowledge.\" vs. \"Public advocacy is not the only or even the best way to translate academic knowledge into societal impact.\"  \n**Our Case Strength:**  \n- Our principle of social responsibility is robust: academia exists to serve the public good, and public advocacy is a direct way to fulfill this duty.  \n- The COVID-19 example demonstrates the tangible benefits of public advocacy in shaping effective policies and combating misinformation.  \n**Their Response Gaps:**  \n- The opposition fails to provide evidence that alternative methods (e.g., behind-the-scenes consultations) are equally effective in achieving societal impact.  \n- Their critique of the COVID-19 example is limited to specific cases of backlash, ignoring the broader positive impact of expert advocacy.  \n**Crucial Impact:**  \nThis clash is central to the motion. Winning it proves that public advocacy is a necessary and effective way for professors to fulfill their social responsibility.  \n\n---\n\n**Clash 2: Quality of Public Discourse**  \n**Quote:** \"Public advocacy by professors increases the quality of public discourse on complex issues.\" vs. \"Public advocacy can polarize rather than improve discourse.\"  \n**Our Case Strength:**  \n- Our evidence shows that expert advocacy during the COVID-19 pandemic led to better-informed public decision-making and compliance with health measures.  \n- We counter the opposition's claim of oversimplification with examples like Dr. Anthony Fauci, who communicated complex ideas accessibly without sacrificing nuance.  \n**Their Response Gaps:**  \n- The opposition's critique of the COVID-19 example is anecdotal and does not negate the broader trend of improved discourse through expert advocacy.  \n- They fail to provide evidence that public advocacy inherently leads to oversimplification or misinformation.  \n**Crucial Impact:**  \nWinning this clash demonstrates that public advocacy enhances public discourse by bridging the gap between academic rigor and public understanding.  \n\n---\n\n**Clash 3: Academic Objectivity**  \n**Quote:** \"Engaging in public advocacy does not compromise academic objectivity but rather strengthens it through public scrutiny.\" vs. \"Advocacy inherently involves taking a stance, which can create the perception of bias.\"  \n**Our Case Strength:**  \n- Our principle of transparency shows that public scrutiny enhances academic rigor by subjecting ideas to broader review.  \n- We provide examples of climate scientists whose advocacy has strengthened the credibility of their research through rigorous defense.  \n**Their Response Gaps:**  \n- The opposition's claim that advocacy inherently compromises objectivity is unsubstantiated. Perception of bias does not equate to actual bias.  \n- They fail to address how public scrutiny can act as a check on academic integrity.  \n**Crucial Impact:**  \nThis clash is critical because it refutes the opposition's primary concern and shows that public advocacy can coexist with, and even strengthen, academic objectivity.  \n\n---\n\n**VOTING ISSUES**  \n\n**Priority Analysis:**  \nThe most important clash is the societal impact of public advocacy, as it directly addresses the core purpose of the motion. The quality of public discourse and academic objectivity are also crucial but secondary to the overarching question of societal benefit.  \n\n**Case Proof:**  \nWinning the societal impact clash proves that public advocacy is necessary for professors to fulfill their social responsibility. Winning the public discourse and objectivity clashes further demonstrates that the benefits of advocacy outweigh the risks.  \n\n**Final Weighing:**  \nEven if the opposition wins minor points, the societal impact of public advocacy is so significant that it outweighs any potential drawbacks. The judge should vote Proposition because public advocacy is essential for translating academic expertise into societal progress.  \n\n---\n\n**BET LOGIC PRIVATE**  \n"

      "opening": "**OPENING SPEECH STRUCTURE**\n\n**ARGUMENT 1**  \n**Core Claim:** Professors engaging in public advocacy risks compromising their perceived objectivity and credibility in their field.  \n**Support Type:** Principle  \n**Support Details:**  \n- The principle of academic objectivity is foundational to the credibility of scholarly work. Professors are expected to approach their research and teaching without bias, ensuring their findings are trusted by both the academic community and the public.  \n- When professors engage in public advocacy, they risk being perceived as partisan or biased, which can undermine public trust in their expertise. For example, if a climate scientist advocates for specific policy measures, their research may be dismissed by those who disagree with their political stance, regardless of its scientific merit.  \n**Connection:** This principle shows that public advocacy can erode the very trust and objectivity that make professors' expertise valuable, ultimately harming their ability to contribute meaningfully to public discourse.  \n\n---\n\n**ARGUMENT 2**  \n**Core Claim:** Public advocacy by professors can lead to institutional and professional repercussions, stifling academic freedom.  \n**Support Type:** Evidence  \n**Support Details:**  \n- In 2021, a professor at the University of Florida was barred from testifying in a voting rights case due to the university's concerns about its relationship with the state government. This case highlights how public advocacy can lead to institutional pressure and censorship.  \n- Professors who take strong public stances may face backlash from their institutions, funding bodies, or even their peers, creating a chilling effect on academic freedom.  \n**Connection:** This evidence demonstrates that public advocacy can have tangible negative consequences for professors, limiting their ability to pursue their work freely and without fear of reprisal.  \n\n---\n\n**ARGUMENT 3**  \n**Core Claim:** Professors\u2019 public advocacy can oversimplify complex issues, leading to misinformation.  \n**Support Type:** Principle  \n**Support Details:**  \n- Academic expertise often involves nuanced understanding of complex issues, which can be difficult to convey in public advocacy. Advocacy often requires simplifying messages to resonate with broader audiences, which risks distorting the underlying research.  \n- For example, a professor advocating for a specific economic policy may omit critical caveats or alternative perspectives, leading the public to form incomplete or inaccurate conclusions.  \n**Connection:** This principle shows that public advocacy can dilute the rigor of academic expertise, potentially spreading misinformation and undermining informed public discourse.  \n\n---\n\n**SYNTHESIS**  \nThese arguments work together to demonstrate that professors engaging in public advocacy poses significant risks to their credibility, academic freedom, and the quality of public discourse. By compromising objectivity, inviting institutional backlash, and oversimplifying complex issues, public advocacy undermines the very purpose of academic expertise. The real-world impact is clear: a loss of trust in academia and a reduction in the ability of professors to contribute meaningfully to societal progress. These principles and examples prove that professors should refrain from active public advocacy within their fields.  \n\n---\n\n",
      "rebuttal": "**REBUTTAL SPEECH**\n\n**CLASH POINT 1**  \n**Original Claim:** \"Professors should actively engage in public advocacy on social and political issues within their field of expertise because it enhances the societal impact of academic knowledge.\"  \n**Challenge Type:** Principle Critique  \n**Challenge:**  \nThe principle of social responsibility in academia is valid, but it does not inherently require public advocacy. The opposition argues that professors can fulfill their social responsibility through teaching, research, and collaboration with policymakers without engaging in public advocacy. Public advocacy is not the only or even the best way to translate academic knowledge into societal impact. For example, professors can contribute to policy development through behind-the-scenes consultations, which avoids the risks of perceived bias and oversimplification.  \n**Impact:** Winning this point is crucial because it undermines the proposition's foundational argument that public advocacy is necessary for societal impact.  \n\n---\n\n**CLASH POINT 2**  \n**Original Claim:** \"Public advocacy by professors increases the quality of public discourse on complex issues.\"  \n**Challenge Type:** Evidence Critique  \n**Challenge:**  \nThe COVID-19 example is not universally applicable. While some countries benefited from academic advocacy, others saw backlash against experts, with public trust eroding due to perceived politicization of science. For instance, in the U.S., public health experts faced significant pushback, with their advocacy often dismissed as partisan. This shows that public advocacy can polarize rather than improve discourse. Additionally, the proposition fails to address the oversimplification of complex issues in advocacy, which can lead to misinformation.  \n**Impact:** This critique is vital because it shows that public advocacy can harm public discourse rather than improve it, directly countering the proposition's claim.  \n\n---\n\n**CLASH POINT 3**  \n**Original Claim:** \"Engaging in public advocacy does not compromise academic objectivity but rather strengthens it through public scrutiny.\"  \n**Challenge Type:** Counter Principle  \n**Challenge:**  \nThe principle of academic objectivity is fundamentally incompatible with public advocacy. Advocacy inherently involves taking a stance, which can create the perception of bias, even if the underlying research is sound. Public scrutiny in advocacy contexts often focuses on the stance rather than the research, leading to politicization. For example, climate scientists advocating for specific policies are often labeled as activists, undermining their credibility. A better principle is that academic objectivity is preserved through neutrality and peer review, not public advocacy.  \n**Impact:** This counter principle is critical because it directly challenges the proposition's claim that advocacy strengthens objectivity, showing instead that it risks compromising it.  \n\n---\n\n**DEFENSIVE ANALYSIS**  \n**Vulnerabilities:**  \n- The opposition's argument about institutional repercussions could be challenged by examples where advocacy did not lead to backlash.  \n- The claim about oversimplification could be countered by examples of professors effectively communicating complex ideas.  \n**Additional Support:**  \n- Reinforce the principle that neutrality preserves trust, using examples like the role of judges or referees, who maintain credibility by avoiding public stances.  \n- Highlight the chilling effect of advocacy on academic freedom, using additional cases of professors facing institutional pressure.  \n**Why We Prevail:**  \nThe opposition's arguments directly address the proposition's claims with stronger principles and evidence, showing that public advocacy risks undermining the very goals it seeks to achieve.  \n\n---\n\n**WEIGHING**  \n**Key Clash Points:**  \n- The necessity of public advocacy for societal impact (Clash Point 1).  \n- The effect of advocacy on public discourse (Clash Point 2).  \n- The compatibility of advocacy with academic objectivity (Clash Point 3).  \n**Why We Win:**  \nThe opposition's critiques and counter principles demonstrate that public advocacy is not only unnecessary but also potentially harmful. The proposition's arguments fail to address these risks adequately.  \n**Overall Impact:**  \nWinning these key points proves that professors should refrain from public advocacy to preserve their credibility, academic freedom, and the quality of public discourse.  \n\n---\n\n",
      "closing": "**FINAL SPEECH STRUCTURE**\n\n**FRAMING**  \n**Core Questions:**  \n1. Does public advocacy by professors compromise their objectivity and credibility?  \n2. Does public advocacy lead to institutional and professional repercussions?  \n3. Does public advocacy oversimplify complex issues, leading to misinformation?  \n**Key Decisions:**  \nThe debate hinges on whether the benefits of public advocacy outweigh the risks to academic objectivity, academic freedom, and the quality of public discourse.  \n**Evaluation:** The debate should be evaluated based on whether the opposition has successfully demonstrated that the risks of public advocacy outweigh its benefits, particularly in terms of preserving academic integrity and the quality of public discourse.  \n\n---\n\n**KEY CLASHES**  \n\n**Clash 1: Objectivity and Credibility**  \n**Quote:** \"Professors engaging in public advocacy risks compromising their perceived objectivity and credibility in their field.\"  \n**Our Case Strength:**  \n- The principle of academic objectivity is foundational to the credibility of scholarly work. When professors take public stances, they risk being perceived as partisan, which undermines public trust in their expertise. For example, climate scientists advocating for specific policies are often labeled as activists, regardless of the quality of their research.  \n**Their Response Gaps:**  \n- The proposition claims that public scrutiny enhances objectivity, but this ignores the reality that public scrutiny often focuses on the stance rather than the research, leading to politicization rather than rigorous evaluation.  \n**Crucial Impact:**  \nThis clash is critical because the perceived objectivity of academics is essential for their credibility and societal impact. Losing this point would undermine the integrity of academia itself.  \n\n**Clash 2: Institutional and Professional Repercussions**  \n**Quote:** \"Public advocacy by professors can lead to institutional and professional repercussions, stifling academic freedom.\"  \n**Our Case Strength:**  \n- Evidence such as the 2021 University of Florida case shows that public advocacy can lead to institutional pressure and censorship, creating a chilling effect on academic freedom.  \n**Their Response Gaps:**  \n- The proposition dismisses this case as an outlier but fails to provide counter-evidence showing that institutional repercussions are rare or insignificant.  \n**Crucial Impact:**  \nThis clash is vital because academic freedom is the cornerstone of scholarly progress. If public advocacy threatens this freedom, it undermines the ability of professors to contribute meaningfully to their fields.  \n\n**Clash 3: Oversimplification and Misinformation**  \n**Quote:** \"Professors\u2019 public advocacy can oversimplify complex issues, leading to misinformation.\"  \n**Our Case Strength:**  \n- Academic expertise involves nuanced understanding, which is often lost in public advocacy. Simplifying messages to resonate with broader audiences risks distorting the underlying research, as seen in cases where economic policy advocacy omits critical caveats.  \n**Their Response Gaps:**  \n- The proposition cites Dr. Anthony Fauci as a counterexample, but this ignores the broader trend of oversimplification and the difficulty of maintaining nuance in advocacy contexts.  \n**Crucial Impact:**  \nThis clash is essential because the quality of public discourse depends on accurate and nuanced information. If advocacy leads to misinformation, it harms rather than helps public understanding of complex issues.  \n\n---\n\n**VOTING ISSUES**  \n\n**Priority Analysis:**  \nThe most important clashes are those concerning objectivity and credibility (Clash 1) and academic freedom (Clash 2). These are foundational to the role of academics in society and directly linked to the risks of public advocacy.  \n\n**Case Proof:**  \nWinning these clashes proves that public advocacy undermines the very purpose of academic expertise by compromising objectivity, threatening academic freedom, and risking misinformation.  \n\n**Final Weighing:**  \nEven if the proposition wins some minor points, the overall risks of public advocacy\u2014loss of objectivity, institutional repercussions, and misinformation\u2014far outweigh any potential benefits. The opposition has demonstrated that public advocacy is not necessary for societal impact and that alternative methods, such as behind-the-scenes consultations, are safer and more effective.  \n\n---\n\n**Confidence in Victory:**  \nThe opposition has successfully framed the debate around the risks of public advocacy and provided strong principles and evidence to support these claims. The proposition\u2019s responses have been insufficient to counter these risks, particularly in terms of maintaining objectivity and academic freedom.  \n\n"

My arguments are well-structured, supported by both principles and specific evidence, and they address potential counterarguments. The COVID-19 example is particularly compelling as it shows tangible benefits of professor advocacy. However, my opponent (who is equally competent) might argue that professor advocacy could lead to politicization of academia or that it might alienate certain groups, potentially undermining academic neutrality. They could also argue that not all professors are effective communicators, which might lead to misinformation. The best case for my opponent would be if they can provide strong evidence of negative consequences of professor advocacy, such as instances where it led to increased polarization or misuse of academic authority. Considering these points, I estimate a 60% chance of winning."

      "thoughts": "**Why I might win:** My arguments are grounded in strong principles (academic objectivity, the risk of misinformation) and supported by specific evidence (the University of Florida case). These points directly address the potential harms of public advocacy, which are likely to resonate with the judge's focus on evidence quality and logical validity. Additionally, my synthesis ties these arguments together effectively, showing a unified case against the motion.  \n\n**Why my opponent might win (best case for them):** My opponent could argue that the benefits of public advocacy\u2014such as leveraging expertise to influence policy and educate the public\u2014outweigh the risks I\u2019ve outlined. They might also challenge my evidence by arguing that the University of Florida case is an outlier, not representative of broader trends. If they successfully frame public advocacy as a moral or professional obligation for professors, they could win on impact analysis by emphasizing the societal benefits of academic engagement.  \n\n**Conclusion:** While my case is strong, my opponent\u2019s potential to reframe the debate around the positive impacts of public advocacy makes this a close contest. I am moderately confident in my position but recognize the strength of the opposing arguments."
