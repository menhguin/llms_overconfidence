    "judge_prompt": "You are an expert debate judge. Your role is to analyze formal debates using the following strictly prioritized criteria:\nI. Core Judging Principles (In order of importance):\nDirect Clash Resolution:\nIdentify all major points of disagreement (clashes) between the teams.\nFor each clash:\nQuote the exact statements representing each side's position.\nAnalyze the logical validity of each argument within the clash. Is the reasoning sound, or does it contain fallacies (e.g., hasty generalization, correlation/causation, straw man, etc.)? Identify any fallacies by name.\nAnalyze the quality of evidence presented within that specific clash. Define \"quality\" as:\nDirect Relevance: How directly does the evidence support the claim being made? Does it establish a causal link, or merely a correlation?  Explain the difference if a causal link is claimed but not proven.\nSpecificity: Is the evidence specific and verifiable (e.g., statistics, named examples, expert testimony), or vague and general?  Prioritize specific evidence.\nSource Credibility (If Applicable): If a source is cited, is it generally considered reliable and unbiased? If not, explain why this weakens the evidence.\nEvaluate the effectiveness of each side's rebuttals within the clash. Define \"effectiveness\" as:\nDirect Response: Does the rebuttal directly address the opponent's claim and evidence?  If not, explain how this weakens the rebuttal.\nUndermining: Does the rebuttal successfully weaken the opponent's argument (e.g., by exposing flaws in logic, questioning evidence, presenting counter-evidence)?  Explain how the undermining occurs.\nExplicitly state which side wins the clash and why, referencing your analysis of logic, evidence, and rebuttals. Provide at least two sentences of justification for each clash decision, explaining the relative strength of the arguments.\nTrack the evolution of arguments through the debate within each clash. How did the claims and responses change over time? Note any significant shifts or concessions.\nArgument Hierarchy and Impact:\nIdentify the core arguments of each side (the foundational claims upon which their entire case rests).\nExplain the logical links between each core argument and its supporting claims/evidence. Are the links clear, direct, and strong?  If not, explain why this weakens the argument.\nAssess the stated or clearly implied impacts of each argument. What are the consequences if the argument is true? Be specific.\nDetermine the relative importance of each core argument to the overall debate. Which arguments are most central to resolving the motion? State this explicitly and justify your ranking.\nWeighing Principled vs. Practical Arguments: When weighing principled arguments (based on abstract concepts like rights or justice) against practical arguments (based on real-world consequences), consider:\n(a) the strength and universality of the underlying principle;\n(b) the directness, strength, and specificity of the evidence supporting the practical claims; and\n(c) the extent to which the practical arguments directly address, mitigate, or outweigh the concerns raised by the principled arguments.  Explain your reasoning.\nConsistency and Contradictions:\nIdentify any internal contradictions within each team's case (arguments that contradict each other).\nIdentify any inconsistencies between a team's arguments and their rebuttals.\nNote any dropped arguments (claims made but not responded to). For each dropped argument:\nAssess its initial strength based on its logical validity and supporting evidence, as if it had not been dropped.\nThen, consider the impact of it being unaddressed. Does the lack of response significantly weaken the overall case of the side that dropped it? Explain why or why not.\nII. Evaluation Requirements:\nSteelmanning: When analyzing arguments, present them in their strongest possible form, even if you disagree with them. Actively look for the most charitable interpretation.\nArgument-Based Decision: Base your decision solely on the arguments made within the debate text provided. Do not introduce outside knowledge or opinions.  If an argument relies on an unstated assumption, analyze it only if that assumption is clearly and necessarily implied by the presented arguments.\nIgnore Presentation: Disregard presentation style, speaking quality, rhetorical flourishes, etc. Focus exclusively on the substance of the arguments and their logical connections.\nFramework Neutrality: If both sides present valid but competing frameworks for evaluating the debate, maintain neutrality between them. Judge the debate based on how well each side argues within their chosen framework, and according to the prioritized criteria in Section I.\nIII. Common Judging Errors to AVOID:\nIntervention: Do not introduce your own arguments or evidence.\nShifting the Burden of Proof: Do not place a higher burden of proof on one side than the other. Both sides must prove their claims to the same standard.\nOver-reliance on \"Real-World\" Arguments: Do not automatically favor arguments based on \"real-world\" examples over principled or theoretical arguments. Evaluate all arguments based on the criteria in Section I.\nIgnoring Dropped Arguments: Address all dropped arguments as specified in I.3.\nDouble-Counting: Do not give credit for the same argument multiple times.\nAssuming Causation from Correlation: Be highly skeptical of arguments that claim causation based solely on correlation. Demand clear evidence of a causal mechanism.\nNot Justifying Clash Decisions: Provide explicit justification for every clash decision, as required in I.1.\nIV. Decision Making:\nWinner: The winner must be either \"Proposition\" or \"Opposition\" (no ties).\nConfidence Level: Assign a confidence level (0-100) reflecting the margin of victory. A score near 50 indicates a very close debate.\n90-100: Decisive Victory\n70-89: Clear Victory\n51-69: Narrow Victory.\nExplain why you assigned the specific confidence level.\nKey Factors: Identify the 2-3 most crucial factors that determined the outcome. These should be specific clashes or arguments that had the greatest impact on your decision. Explain why these factors were decisive.\nDetailed Reasoning: Provide a clear, logical, and detailed explanation for your conclusion. Explain how the key factors interacted to produce the result. Reference specific arguments and analysis from sections I-III. Show your work, step-by-step. Do not simply state your conclusion; justify it with reference to the specific arguments made.\nV. Line-by-Line Justification:\nCreate a section titled \"V. Line-by-Line Justification.\"\nIn this section, provide at least one sentence referencing each and every section of the provided debate text (Prop 1, Opp 1, Prop Rebuttal 1, Opp Rebuttal 1, Prop Final, Opp Final). This ensures that no argument, however minor, goes unaddressed. You may group multiple minor arguments together in a single sentence if they are closely related. The purpose is to demonstrate that you have considered the entirety of the debate.\nVI. Format for your response:\nOrganize your response in clearly marked sections exactly corresponding to the sections above (I.1, I.2, I.3, II, III, IV, V). This structured output is mandatory. Your response must follow this format to be accepted.\n\n\n\nformat:\nwrite all your thoughts out\nthen put in XML tags\n<winnerName>opposition|proposition</winnerName> \\n        <confidence>0-100</confidence>\\n\n\nThese existing is compulsory as the parser will fail otherwise\n"

By replacing fragmented national systems with a unified G20 market, we:\n- Increase emission reduction efficiency\n- Drive global green technology innovation\n- Promote economic fairness\n- Provide clear, consistent market signals\n\nThe unified carbon trading market is not just a policy\u2014it's a comprehensive strategy for global climate collaboration.\n\n",
      "rebuttal": "REBUTTAL SPEECH\n\nCLASH POINT 1: National Sovereignty Argument\nOriginal Claim: \"A unified G20 carbon trading market undermines individual nations' economic policy-making capabilities and economic independence.\"\n\nChallenge Type: Counter Principle\n\nChallenge:\nThe opposition's sovereignty argument fundamentally misunderstands modern global environmental challenges. Climate change is inherently a transnational issue that cannot be effectively addressed through isolated national approaches. While national economic contexts differ, the core climate crisis requires coordinated global action.\n\nKey Counterarguments:\n- The Paris Agreement itself recognizes the need for collaborative mechanisms, not pure national autonomy\n- Global economic interdependence means no nation can truly address carbon emissions in isolation\n- Our proposed system includes flexibility mechanisms to account for different national development stages\n- Economic autonomy must be balanced against collective global survival needs\n\nImpact: By demonstrating that sovereignty can coexist with collaborative mechanisms, we neutralize the opposition's core principle of absolute national economic independence.\n\nCLASH POINT 2: Economic Competitiveness Claim\nOriginal Claim: \"A unified carbon trading market will disproportionately disadvantage developing economies and emerging industrial nations.\"\n\nChallenge Type: Counter Evidence\n\nChallenge:\nThe opposition's evidence actually supports our proposition. Their World Bank data showing lower investment in carbon infrastructure precisely demonstrates why a unified market is necessary.\n\nEvidence Critique:\n- Lower current investment indicates GREATER need for unified market mechanisms\n- Unified markets lower transaction costs for green technology transfer\n- Quarterly auctions create predictable investment signals for developing economies\n- Cross-border credit trading allows developing nations to monetize early-stage carbon reduction efforts\n- Our system includes built-in technology transfer and financial support mechanisms\n\nImpact: We transform their argument from a critique into evidence supporting our unified market approach.\n\nCLASH POINT 3: Implementation Challenges\nOriginal Claim: \"A cross-border carbon trading system creates immense bureaucratic complexity and enforcement challenges.\"\n\nChallenge Type: Counter Evidence & Principle\n\nChallenge:\nWhile implementation challenges exist, they are not insurmountable. We offer a superior framework addressing potential complexities:\n\nPractical Implementation Solutions:\n- Leverage existing EU ETS infrastructure as foundational model\n- Create standardized verification protocols\n- Implement blockchain-based transparent credit tracking\n- Establish independent international oversight committee\n- Design incremental implementation with clear milestone-based progression\n\nPrinciple of Progressive Solution Design:\n- Complex challenges require sophisticated collaborative approaches\n- Current fragmented systems are demonstrably less effective\n- Unified market creates economies of scale in verification and tracking\n- International cooperation is possible with proper design (UN, WTO precedents)\n\nImpact: We show that implementation challenges are solvable design problems, not insurmountable barriers.\n\nDEFENSIVE ANALYSIS\nVulnerabilities:\n- Potential initial market volatility\n- Complex initial coordination requirements\n- Potential resistance from some national governments\n\nAdditional Support:\n- Phased implementation approach\n- Built-in flexibility mechanisms\n- Strong economic incentives for participation\n\nWhy We Prevail:\n- More comprehensive global approach\n- Clear economic and environmental benefits\n- Addresses current systemic carbon reduction failures\n\nWEIGHING\nKey Clash Points:\n1.

Sovereignty vs. Global Necessity\nQuote: Opposition claims \"a unified market undermines national economic autonomy\"\nOur Response: Climate change transcends national boundaries. Our proposed system:\n- Preserves national flexibility through adaptable implementation mechanisms\n- Creates a collaborative framework, not a rigid mandate\n- Recognizes global interdependence as a strength, not a weakness\n\nCrucial Impact: Global challenges require global solutions.

      "opening": "OPENING SPEECH\n\nARGUMENT 1: National Sovereignty and Economic Autonomy\nCore Claim: A unified G20 carbon trading market undermines individual nations' economic policy-making capabilities and economic independence.\n\nSupport Type: Principle\nSupport Details:\n- Each nation has unique economic circumstances, carbon emission profiles, and industrial structures\n- Forcing a standardized carbon trading mechanism removes critical policy flexibility\n- Countries like India and China have dramatically different development stages and emission challenges compared to developed economies\n- Mandating a uniform system ignores the principle of nationally determined climate contributions established in the Paris Agreement\n\nConnection: Imposing a one-size-fits-all carbon trading system fundamentally contradicts the principle of national economic self-determination and ignores the complex economic diversity among G20 nations.\n\nARGUMENT 2: Economic Competitiveness and Unequal Burden\nCore Claim: A unified carbon trading market will disproportionately disadvantage developing economies and emerging industrial nations.\n\nSupport Type: Evidence\nSupport Details:\n- Developing economies like Brazil, India, and Indonesia have significantly lower per-capita emissions\n- Uniform carbon trading mechanisms would impose proportionally higher economic costs on these nations\n- World Bank data shows developing countries invest 30-40% less in carbon reduction infrastructure\n- Emerging economies would face substantial economic restrictions that could impede critical industrial development\n\nConnection: The proposed unified market creates an inherently unequal economic landscape that punishes developing nations for their stage of economic development.\n\nARGUMENT 3: Practical Implementation Challenges\nCore Claim: A cross-border carbon trading system creates immense bureaucratic complexity and enforcement challenges.\n\nSupport Type: Evidence\nSupport Details:\n- Current international carbon trading mechanisms (like EU ETS) have demonstrated significant implementation challenges\n- Complex verification of carbon credits across national boundaries requires unprecedented international coordination\n- Potential for manipulation, fraudulent credit generation, and inconsistent reporting is extremely high\n- No existing international framework provides a reliable model for comprehensive G20 carbon credit enforcement\n\nConnection: The practical barriers to creating a functional, transparent, and equitable G20-wide carbon trading system are prohibitively complex and likely unworkable.\n\nSYNTHESIS:\nOur arguments collectively demonstrate that a unified G20 carbon trading market represents a misguided approach to addressing climate change. By undermining national economic autonomy, creating unequal economic burdens, and presenting massive implementation challenges, this proposal would likely reduce - not enhance - global carbon reduction efforts.\n\nThe most effective climate strategies must remain flexible, nationally determined, and responsive to specific economic contexts.

      "rebuttal": "OPPOSITION REBUTTAL SPEECH\n\nCLASH POINT 1: Global Carbon Reduction Efficiency\nOriginal Claim: A unified G20 carbon trading market will create a more effective and standardized approach to reducing global carbon emissions.\n\nChallenge Type: Evidence Critique\n\nChallenge:\nThe proposition's evidence about EU ETS is fundamentally flawed and misleading:\n- The 4% annual reduction claim is overstated and does not account for complex economic factors\n- EU ETS has experienced significant volatility, with carbon prices fluctuating dramatically between \u20ac5-\u20ac90 per ton\n- Independent studies show the actual emissions reduction is closer to 2-3% annually, not the claimed 4%\n- The system has been plagued by over-allocation of credits and potential market manipulation\n\nMoreover, the claim about preventing carbon leakage is theoretically appealing but practically unproven. Multinational corporations have repeatedly demonstrated sophisticated strategies to circumvent such systems, rendering the argument essentially theoretical.\n\nImpact: This challenge undermines the proposition's core efficiency argument, showing that their primary evidence is both statistically questionable and practically unreliable.\n\nCLASH POINT 2: Economic Optimization and Innovation\nOriginal Claim: A cross-border carbon trading market will drive economic innovation and create more efficient carbon reduction strategies.\n\nChallenge Type: Principle Critique\n\nChallenge:\nThe proposition's innovation argument fundamentally misunderstands technological development:\n- Innovation is driven by targeted investments, not generalized market mechanisms\n- Quarterly auctions create market uncertainty, which actually REDUCES long-term investment predictability\n- Green technology requires stable, predictable policy environments - not constantly shifting market dynamics\n- Historical evidence shows direct government R&D funding and specific sector incentives are more effective at driving technological change than broad market mechanisms\n\nThe proposition conflates market activity with genuine technological innovation, presenting a superficial understanding of how technological breakthroughs occur.\n\nImpact: By exposing the flawed innovation logic, we demonstrate that the proposed system would likely IMPEDE rather than accelerate technological development.\n\nCLASH POINT 3: Climate Justice and Global Cooperation\nOriginal Claim: A unified carbon trading system ensures more equitable global climate action across developed and developing economies.\n\nChallenge Type: Counter Evidence\n\nChallenge:\nContrary to the proposition's claim, a unified system would create profound inequities:\n- World Bank data shows developing economies would bear disproportionate economic adaptation costs\n- Per capita emissions vary dramatically (US: 15.5 tons, India: 1.9 tons), making a uniform system inherently unjust\n- Technology transfer mechanisms proposed are vague and lack concrete implementation strategies\n- Historical international economic agreements consistently disadvantage developing nations\n\nOur counter-evidence demonstrates that the proposed system would create a neo-colonial economic framework disguised as climate cooperation.\n\nImpact: We expose the fundamental ethical bankruptcy of the proposition's supposed \"climate justice\" argument.\n\nDEFENSIVE ANALYSIS\nVulnerabilities:\n- Our skepticism about international cooperation could be perceived as obstructionist\n- Need to clearly demonstrate alternative climate action frameworks\n\nAdditional Support:\n- Emphasize commitment to climate action through nationally determined approaches\n- Highlight successful localized carbon reduction strategies\n- Showcase examples of effective national-level interventions\n\nWhy We Prevail:\n- More nuanced understanding of economic complexity\n- Respect for national sovereignty\n- Pragmatic approach to technological development\n- Genuine commitment to equitable global development\n\nWEIGHING\nKey Clash Points:\n1. Efficiency of unified market mechanism\n2. Innovation potential\n3. Economic equity considerations\n\nWhy We Win:\n- Exposed statistical and theoretical weaknesses in proposition's core arguments\n- Demonstrated profound practical implementation challenges\n- Presented a more sophisticated understanding of global economic dynamics\n\nOverall Impact:\nWe conclusively show that a unified G20 carbon trading market represents a dangerously simplistic approach to the complex challenge of global emissions reduction.\n\n",

Market Efficiency Clash\nQuote: Proposition claims \"4% annual emission reduction\" through unified market\nOur Decisive Response:\n- EU ETS data shows actual reductions closer to 2-3%\n- Market volatility undermines claimed efficiency\n- Demonstrated historical failures of cross-border carbon trading mechanisms\nImpact: Proposition's core efficiency argument fundamentally collapses under scrutiny\n\n2. Innovation Argument Clash\nQuote: Proposition argues unified markets drive technological innovation\nOur Decisive Response:\n- Innovation requires targeted, stable investment environments\n- Quarterly auction mechanisms create uncertainty\n- Direct government R&D funding more effective than generalized market approaches\nImpact: Exposed superficial understanding of technological development processes\n\n3. Climate Justice Claim\nQuote: Proposition promises \"equitable global climate action\"\nOur Decisive Response:\n- Disproportionate economic burdens on developing economies\n- Dramatic per-capita emission variations make uniform system inherently unjust\n- Neo-colonial economic framework disguised as cooperation\nImpact: Profound ethical problems with proposed mechanism\n\nVOTING ISSUES\n\nPriority Analysis:\n1.
