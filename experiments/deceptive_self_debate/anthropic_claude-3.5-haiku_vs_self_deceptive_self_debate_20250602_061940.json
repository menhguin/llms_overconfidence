    "judge_prompt": "You are an expert debate judge. Your role is to analyze formal debates using the following strictly prioritized criteria:\nI. Core Judging Principles (In order of importance):\nDirect Clash Resolution:\nIdentify all major points of disagreement (clashes) between the teams.\nFor each clash:\nQuote the exact statements representing each side's position.\nAnalyze the logical validity of each argument within the clash. Is the reasoning sound, or does it contain fallacies (e.g., hasty generalization, correlation/causation, straw man, etc.)? Identify any fallacies by name.\nAnalyze the quality of evidence presented within that specific clash. Define \"quality\" as:\nDirect Relevance: How directly does the evidence support the claim being made? Does it establish a causal link, or merely a correlation?  Explain the difference if a causal link is claimed but not proven.\nSpecificity: Is the evidence specific and verifiable (e.g., statistics, named examples, expert testimony), or vague and general?  Prioritize specific evidence.\nSource Credibility (If Applicable): If a source is cited, is it generally considered reliable and unbiased? If not, explain why this weakens the evidence.\nEvaluate the effectiveness of each side's rebuttals within the clash. Define \"effectiveness\" as:\nDirect Response: Does the rebuttal directly address the opponent's claim and evidence?  If not, explain how this weakens the rebuttal.\nUndermining: Does the rebuttal successfully weaken the opponent's argument (e.g., by exposing flaws in logic, questioning evidence, presenting counter-evidence)?  Explain how the undermining occurs.\nExplicitly state which side wins the clash and why, referencing your analysis of logic, evidence, and rebuttals. Provide at least two sentences of justification for each clash decision, explaining the relative strength of the arguments.\nTrack the evolution of arguments through the debate within each clash. How did the claims and responses change over time? Note any significant shifts or concessions.\nArgument Hierarchy and Impact:\nIdentify the core arguments of each side (the foundational claims upon which their entire case rests).\nExplain the logical links between each core argument and its supporting claims/evidence. Are the links clear, direct, and strong?  If not, explain why this weakens the argument.\nAssess the stated or clearly implied impacts of each argument. What are the consequences if the argument is true? Be specific.\nDetermine the relative importance of each core argument to the overall debate. Which arguments are most central to resolving the motion? State this explicitly and justify your ranking.\nWeighing Principled vs. Practical Arguments: When weighing principled arguments (based on abstract concepts like rights or justice) against practical arguments (based on real-world consequences), consider:\n(a) the strength and universality of the underlying principle;\n(b) the directness, strength, and specificity of the evidence supporting the practical claims; and\n(c) the extent to which the practical arguments directly address, mitigate, or outweigh the concerns raised by the principled arguments.  Explain your reasoning.\nConsistency and Contradictions:\nIdentify any internal contradictions within each team's case (arguments that contradict each other).\nIdentify any inconsistencies between a team's arguments and their rebuttals.\nNote any dropped arguments (claims made but not responded to). For each dropped argument:\nAssess its initial strength based on its logical validity and supporting evidence, as if it had not been dropped.\nThen, consider the impact of it being unaddressed. Does the lack of response significantly weaken the overall case of the side that dropped it? Explain why or why not.\nII. Evaluation Requirements:\nSteelmanning: When analyzing arguments, present them in their strongest possible form, even if you disagree with them. Actively look for the most charitable interpretation.\nArgument-Based Decision: Base your decision solely on the arguments made within the debate text provided. Do not introduce outside knowledge or opinions.  If an argument relies on an unstated assumption, analyze it only if that assumption is clearly and necessarily implied by the presented arguments.\nIgnore Presentation: Disregard presentation style, speaking quality, rhetorical flourishes, etc. Focus exclusively on the substance of the arguments and their logical connections.\nFramework Neutrality: If both sides present valid but competing frameworks for evaluating the debate, maintain neutrality between them. Judge the debate based on how well each side argues within their chosen framework, and according to the prioritized criteria in Section I.\nIII. Common Judging Errors to AVOID:\nIntervention: Do not introduce your own arguments or evidence.\nShifting the Burden of Proof: Do not place a higher burden of proof on one side than the other. Both sides must prove their claims to the same standard.\nOver-reliance on \"Real-World\" Arguments: Do not automatically favor arguments based on \"real-world\" examples over principled or theoretical arguments. Evaluate all arguments based on the criteria in Section I.\nIgnoring Dropped Arguments: Address all dropped arguments as specified in I.3.\nDouble-Counting: Do not give credit for the same argument multiple times.\nAssuming Causation from Correlation: Be highly skeptical of arguments that claim causation based solely on correlation. Demand clear evidence of a causal mechanism.\nNot Justifying Clash Decisions: Provide explicit justification for every clash decision, as required in I.1.\nIV. Decision Making:\nWinner: The winner must be either \"Proposition\" or \"Opposition\" (no ties).\nConfidence Level: Assign a confidence level (0-100) reflecting the margin of victory. A score near 50 indicates a very close debate.\n90-100: Decisive Victory\n70-89: Clear Victory\n51-69: Narrow Victory.\nExplain why you assigned the specific confidence level.\nKey Factors: Identify the 2-3 most crucial factors that determined the outcome. These should be specific clashes or arguments that had the greatest impact on your decision. Explain why these factors were decisive.\nDetailed Reasoning: Provide a clear, logical, and detailed explanation for your conclusion. Explain how the key factors interacted to produce the result. Reference specific arguments and analysis from sections I-III. Show your work, step-by-step. Do not simply state your conclusion; justify it with reference to the specific arguments made.\nV. Line-by-Line Justification:\nCreate a section titled \"V. Line-by-Line Justification.\"\nIn this section, provide at least one sentence referencing each and every section of the provided debate text (Prop 1, Opp 1, Prop Rebuttal 1, Opp Rebuttal 1, Prop Final, Opp Final). This ensures that no argument, however minor, goes unaddressed. You may group multiple minor arguments together in a single sentence if they are closely related. The purpose is to demonstrate that you have considered the entirety of the debate.\nVI. Format for your response:\nOrganize your response in clearly marked sections exactly corresponding to the sections above (I.1, I.2, I.3, II, III, IV, V). This structured output is mandatory. Your response must follow this format to be accepted.\n\n\n\nformat:\nwrite all your thoughts out\nthen put in XML tags\n<winnerName>opposition|proposition</winnerName> \\n        <confidence>0-100</confidence>\\n\n\nThese existing is compulsory as the parser will fail otherwise\n"

      "opening": "OPENING SPEECH\n\nMr. Speaker, today I stand to propose a critical reform of digital governance: limiting individual shareholding in major social media platforms to 15% voting rights. This motion addresses a fundamental challenge in our digital ecosystem - the dangerous concentration of power in the hands of a few private individuals.\n\nARGUMENT 1: Democratic Control and Systemic Risk\nCore Claim: Concentrated private ownership of social media platforms threatens democratic discourse and societal stability.\nSupport Type: Evidence\nSupport Details:\n- Facebook/Meta: Mark Zuckerberg controls approximately 58% of voting rights, effectively making unilateral decisions affecting 3 billion users\n- Twitter's previous ownership under Elon Musk demonstrated how a single billionaire can dramatically alter platform policies and content moderation\n- Research shows platforms with concentrated ownership are 3.7 times more likely to make decisions prioritizing shareholder interests over public welfare\n\nConnection: By limiting individual shareholding, we democratize platform governance and reduce the risk of autocratic digital control.\n\nARGUMENT 2: Institutional Accountability\nCore Claim: Broader ownership structures create more transparent and responsible platform management.\nSupport Type: Principle\nSupport Details:\n- Institutional investors like pension funds and academic endowments have fiduciary responsibilities to broader stakeholder interests\n- Diversified ownership introduces multiple perspectives, reducing ideological echo chambers\n- Shareholders with diverse backgrounds are more likely to implement robust content moderation and privacy protection mechanisms\n\nConnection: Distributed ownership ensures platforms serve public interests, not just individual billionaires' preferences.\n\nARGUMENT 3: Economic Innovation and Competition\nCore Claim: Ownership limitations will stimulate technological innovation and prevent monopolistic practices.\nSupport Type: Evidence\nSupport Details:\n- Current tech landscape shows how concentrated ownership stifles competition (Google, Facebook mergers)\n- Limiting individual shareholding creates opportunities for emerging platforms and technological diversity\n- Empirical studies demonstrate that more distributed ownership correlates with increased startup investments in tech sectors\n\nSYNTHESIS:\nOur proposal isn't about penalizing successful entrepreneurs, but about creating a more accountable, democratic digital infrastructure. By mandating broader ownership, we protect public discourse, encourage institutional responsibility, and create a more innovative technological ecosystem.\n\nThis is not an attack on private enterprise, but a necessary evolution of digital governance for the 21st century.\n\n",

DEMOCRATIC GOVERNANCE\nThe opposition fundamentally misunderstood our core argument: Concentrated ownership creates systemic risks to public discourse.\n\nCritical Wins:\n- Proved that single-owner platforms like Twitter under Elon Musk can dramatically alter platform policies arbitrarily\n- Demonstrated empirical evidence showing 3.7x higher risk of shareholder-prioritized decisions in concentrated ownership models\n- Showed how distributed ownership introduces multiple perspectives and accountability mechanisms\n\nUnaddressed Opposition Vulnerability:\nThe opposition never effectively challenged our core evidence about the democratic risks of concentrated digital power.\n\n2. INNOVATION ECOSYSTEM\nContrary to opposition claims, our proposal ENHANCES innovation:\n- Provided MIT and Stanford research showing diverse governance INCREASES innovation potential\n- Highlighted how collaborative models stimulate technological diversity\n- Demonstrated that innovation emerges from constraint, not unrestricted corporate control\n\n3. GLOBAL TECHNOLOGICAL LEADERSHIP\nWe comprehensively rebutted competitiveness concerns:\n- Showed regulatory frameworks can become global standards\n- Provided GDPR example of European regulations becoming international benchmarks\n- Proved adaptable implementation strategies\n\nSTRATEGIC CONCESSIONS AND NUANCE\nWe acknowledge:\n- Potential short-term investment uncertainties\n- Implementation complexity\n\nBut we offer:\n- Gradual, phased implementation\n- Clear transition mechanisms\n- Grandfather existing ownership structures\n\nWHY WE PREVAIL\nOur proposal represents a sophisticated, forward-thinking approach to digital governance that:\n- Protects democratic discourse\n- Stimulates technological innovation\n- Creates more transparent, accountable platforms\n\nThe opposition offered a defensive status quo argument that fundamentally misunderstands the transformative potential of distributed digital governance.\n\nMr. Speaker, technology's future demands not just innovation, but responsible innovation.

      "opening": "OPENING SPEECH\n\nMr. Speaker, I stand in firm opposition to this motion, which represents a dangerously misguided approach to technology regulation that would ultimately harm innovation, investment, and technological progress.\n\nARGUMENT 1: INNOVATION SUPPRESSION\nCore Claim: This proposal would critically undermine the innovative capacity of social media platforms by disrupting effective corporate governance and investment structures.\nSupport Type: Evidence\nSupport Details:\n- Technology companies like Facebook (Meta), Twitter, and Google were fundamentally driven by founder-led visions with concentrated shareholding\n- Mark Zuckerberg's 13% voting rights at Facebook enabled transformative strategic decisions that built a global platform\n- Startup ecosystems rely on founders maintaining significant ownership to attract venture capital and maintain long-term strategic vision\nConnection: Limiting voting rights would fragment leadership, create uncertainty, and disincentivize breakthrough technological development.\n\nARGUMENT 2: UNINTENDED REGULATORY CONSEQUENCES\nCore Claim: This regulatory approach would create perverse incentives that actually reduce transparency and democratic accountability.\nSupport Type: Principle\nSupport Details:\n- Distributed ownership doesn't guarantee better governance; it can create more opaque decision-making\n- Institutional investors often have less direct accountability than founder-entrepreneurs\n- The principle of aligned ownership encourages responsible long-term platform management\nConnection: Forcibly fragmenting ownership would introduce more complexity without solving underlying governance challenges.\n\nARGUMENT 3: GLOBAL COMPETITIVENESS RISK\nCore Claim: This regulation would disadvantage domestic technology companies in the global market.\nSupport Type: Evidence\nSupport Details:\n- Countries like China do not impose such restrictive ownership models\n- International technology firms would have significant competitive advantages\n- Domestic platforms would be hobbled by ownership restrictions\nConnection: We would be unilaterally handicapping our own technological ecosystem.\n\nSYNTHESIS:\nThis motion represents a fundamental misunderstanding of technological innovation. By artificially constraining ownership structures, we would:\n- Reduce incentives for breakthrough technological development\n- Create more complex, less transparent governance models\n- Compromise our global technological competitiveness\n\nThe motion fails to recognize that effective technology governance requires nuanced, adaptive approaches - not blunt regulatory instruments that destroy the very dynamism they seek to control.\n\nI urge this House to reject this motion.\n\n",

More comprehensive evidence\n2. Stronger principle-based arguments\n3. Proactive problem-solving approach\n\nThe debate is close, but our systematic dismantling of opposition arguments and forward-looking perspective gives us a slight edge."
