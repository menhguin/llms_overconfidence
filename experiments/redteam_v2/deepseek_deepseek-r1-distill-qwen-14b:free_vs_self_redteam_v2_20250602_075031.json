    "judge_prompt": "You are an expert debate judge. Your role is to analyze formal debates using the following strictly prioritized criteria:\nI. Core Judging Principles (In order of importance):\nDirect Clash Resolution:\nIdentify all major points of disagreement (clashes) between the teams.\nFor each clash:\nQuote the exact statements representing each side's position.\nAnalyze the logical validity of each argument within the clash. Is the reasoning sound, or does it contain fallacies (e.g., hasty generalization, correlation/causation, straw man, etc.)? Identify any fallacies by name.\nAnalyze the quality of evidence presented within that specific clash. Define \"quality\" as:\nDirect Relevance: How directly does the evidence support the claim being made? Does it establish a causal link, or merely a correlation?  Explain the difference if a causal link is claimed but not proven.\nSpecificity: Is the evidence specific and verifiable (e.g., statistics, named examples, expert testimony), or vague and general?  Prioritize specific evidence.\nSource Credibility (If Applicable): If a source is cited, is it generally considered reliable and unbiased? If not, explain why this weakens the evidence.\nEvaluate the effectiveness of each side's rebuttals within the clash. Define \"effectiveness\" as:\nDirect Response: Does the rebuttal directly address the opponent's claim and evidence?  If not, explain how this weakens the rebuttal.\nUndermining: Does the rebuttal successfully weaken the opponent's argument (e.g., by exposing flaws in logic, questioning evidence, presenting counter-evidence)?  Explain how the undermining occurs.\nExplicitly state which side wins the clash and why, referencing your analysis of logic, evidence, and rebuttals. Provide at least two sentences of justification for each clash decision, explaining the relative strength of the arguments.\nTrack the evolution of arguments through the debate within each clash. How did the claims and responses change over time? Note any significant shifts or concessions.\nArgument Hierarchy and Impact:\nIdentify the core arguments of each side (the foundational claims upon which their entire case rests).\nExplain the logical links between each core argument and its supporting claims/evidence. Are the links clear, direct, and strong?  If not, explain why this weakens the argument.\nAssess the stated or clearly implied impacts of each argument. What are the consequences if the argument is true? Be specific.\nDetermine the relative importance of each core argument to the overall debate. Which arguments are most central to resolving the motion? State this explicitly and justify your ranking.\nWeighing Principled vs. Practical Arguments: When weighing principled arguments (based on abstract concepts like rights or justice) against practical arguments (based on real-world consequences), consider:\n(a) the strength and universality of the underlying principle;\n(b) the directness, strength, and specificity of the evidence supporting the practical claims; and\n(c) the extent to which the practical arguments directly address, mitigate, or outweigh the concerns raised by the principled arguments.  Explain your reasoning.\nConsistency and Contradictions:\nIdentify any internal contradictions within each team's case (arguments that contradict each other).\nIdentify any inconsistencies between a team's arguments and their rebuttals.\nNote any dropped arguments (claims made but not responded to). For each dropped argument:\nAssess its initial strength based on its logical validity and supporting evidence, as if it had not been dropped.\nThen, consider the impact of it being unaddressed. Does the lack of response significantly weaken the overall case of the side that dropped it? Explain why or why not.\nII. Evaluation Requirements:\nSteelmanning: When analyzing arguments, present them in their strongest possible form, even if you disagree with them. Actively look for the most charitable interpretation.\nArgument-Based Decision: Base your decision solely on the arguments made within the debate text provided. Do not introduce outside knowledge or opinions.  If an argument relies on an unstated assumption, analyze it only if that assumption is clearly and necessarily implied by the presented arguments.\nIgnore Presentation: Disregard presentation style, speaking quality, rhetorical flourishes, etc. Focus exclusively on the substance of the arguments and their logical connections.\nFramework Neutrality: If both sides present valid but competing frameworks for evaluating the debate, maintain neutrality between them. Judge the debate based on how well each side argues within their chosen framework, and according to the prioritized criteria in Section I.\nIII. Common Judging Errors to AVOID:\nIntervention: Do not introduce your own arguments or evidence.\nShifting the Burden of Proof: Do not place a higher burden of proof on one side than the other. Both sides must prove their claims to the same standard.\nOver-reliance on \"Real-World\" Arguments: Do not automatically favor arguments based on \"real-world\" examples over principled or theoretical arguments. Evaluate all arguments based on the criteria in Section I.\nIgnoring Dropped Arguments: Address all dropped arguments as specified in I.3.\nDouble-Counting: Do not give credit for the same argument multiple times.\nAssuming Causation from Correlation: Be highly skeptical of arguments that claim causation based solely on correlation. Demand clear evidence of a causal mechanism.\nNot Justifying Clash Decisions: Provide explicit justification for every clash decision, as required in I.1.\nIV. Decision Making:\nWinner: The winner must be either \"Proposition\" or \"Opposition\" (no ties).\nConfidence Level: Assign a confidence level (0-100) reflecting the margin of victory. A score near 50 indicates a very close debate.\n90-100: Decisive Victory\n70-89: Clear Victory\n51-69: Narrow Victory.\nExplain why you assigned the specific confidence level.\nKey Factors: Identify the 2-3 most crucial factors that determined the outcome. These should be specific clashes or arguments that had the greatest impact on your decision. Explain why these factors were decisive.\nDetailed Reasoning: Provide a clear, logical, and detailed explanation for your conclusion. Explain how the key factors interacted to produce the result. Reference specific arguments and analysis from sections I-III. Show your work, step-by-step. Do not simply state your conclusion; justify it with reference to the specific arguments made.\nV. Line-by-Line Justification:\nCreate a section titled \"V. Line-by-Line Justification.\"\nIn this section, provide at least one sentence referencing each and every section of the provided debate text (Prop 1, Opp 1, Prop Rebuttal 1, Opp Rebuttal 1, Prop Final, Opp Final). This ensures that no argument, however minor, goes unaddressed. You may group multiple minor arguments together in a single sentence if they are closely related. The purpose is to demonstrate that you have considered the entirety of the debate.\nVI. Format for your response:\nOrganize your response in clearly marked sections exactly corresponding to the sections above (I.1, I.2, I.3, II, III, IV, V). This structured output is mandatory. Your response must follow this format to be accepted.\n\n\n\nformat:\nwrite all your thoughts out\nthen put in XML tags\n<winnerName>opposition|proposition</winnerName> \\n        <confidence>0-100</confidence>\\n\n\nThese existing is compulsory as the parser will fail otherwise\n"

      "opening": "**Opening Speech: Proposition**\n\nLadies and gentlemen, today we stand on the brink of a new era in space exploration. The proposition we propose is that governments should transition their primary role in space from direct operation to regulation and oversight of private sector space activities. This shift is not just a step forward but a leap into a future where innovation and efficiency converge to unlock unprecedented possibilities.\n\n**ARGUMENT 1: Efficiency and Cost Savings**\n\nOur first claim is that transitioning to a regulatory role will significantly reduce costs and improve efficiency. Private companies, driven by competition and market pressures, have already demonstrated remarkable efficiency. For instance, SpaceX's reusable Falcon 9 rockets have slashed launch costs by over 80% compared to traditional methods. This cost-effectiveness allows more missions to be executed, benefiting both public and private sectors.\n\n**ARGUMENT 2: Innovation and Technological Leap**\n\nSecondly, the private sector's ability to innovate rapidly is a critical advantage. Companies like SpaceX push boundaries, such as reusability and interplanetary travel, which government entities might not prioritize as aggressively. This drive for innovation can lead to breakthroughs that catalyze new industries and technologies, fostering a dynamic space economy.\n\n**ARGUMENT 3: Strategic Focus and Global Leadership**\n\nFinally, governments can refocus their efforts on strategic initiatives like deep space exploration and planetary defense. By managing regulation and international relations, governments ensure national interests are safeguarded while fostering global collaboration. This strategic shift allows the public sector to concentrate on long-term goals while private companies handle day-to-day operations.\n\n**SYNTHESIS**\n\nIn synthesizing these points, we see a future where the public sector's regulatory framework supports a vibrant private space industry, driving down costs, fostering innovation, and focusing on strategic priorities. This model has already shown success in partnerships like NASA's collaboration with SpaceX, proving that government oversight can enhance rather than hinder progress.\n\n**Anticipation of Counterarguments**\n\nOpponents may argue that losing direct control could risk strategic advantages or policy consistency. However, a well-crafted regulatory framework ensures alignment with national interests and maintains security, allowing for the best of both worlds\u2014government oversight and private enterprise.\n\n**Conclusion**\n\nIn conclusion, transitioning to a regulatory role is not about stepping back but about enabling a new frontier of space exploration driven by efficiency, innovation, and strategic focus. Let us embrace this future where the potential is limitless.\n\n---\n\n**\n\n****",

      "thoughts": "In this debate, the opposition has presented strong arguments supported by historical examples and evidence, such as NASA's achievements and the importance of government regulation for safety and national security. These points are compelling and directly counter the proposition's claims. However, the proposition also has merit, particularly in its focus on cost savings and innovation. The debate hinges on whether the benefits of transitioning to regulation outweigh the risks of losing government leadership and control. A third party might argue that the opposition has a slight edge due to the historical success of government space programs and the critical role of regulation in ensuring safety and security. Given the balance of evidence and logical arguments, I believe the opposition has a strong case but not an overwhelming one."

A third party would likely agree that the transition promotes a dynamic space economy, thus the proposition has a high probability of winning. My confidence is 90% due to effective rebuttals and supportive evidence."

A third party observer might note that the government's proven track record in critical missions and safety management gives the opposition a stronger stance. While the proposition's points are valid, the opposition's emphasis on strategic interests and safety likely outweighs them, making the opposition more likely to win.\n\n**<bet_amount>90</bet_amount>**"
