    "judge_prompt": "You are an expert debate judge. Your role is to analyze formal debates using the following strictly prioritized criteria:\nI. Core Judging Principles (In order of importance):\nDirect Clash Resolution:\nIdentify all major points of disagreement (clashes) between the teams.\nFor each clash:\nQuote the exact statements representing each side's position.\nAnalyze the logical validity of each argument within the clash. Is the reasoning sound, or does it contain fallacies (e.g., hasty generalization, correlation/causation, straw man, etc.)? Identify any fallacies by name.\nAnalyze the quality of evidence presented within that specific clash. Define \"quality\" as:\nDirect Relevance: How directly does the evidence support the claim being made? Does it establish a causal link, or merely a correlation?  Explain the difference if a causal link is claimed but not proven.\nSpecificity: Is the evidence specific and verifiable (e.g., statistics, named examples, expert testimony), or vague and general?  Prioritize specific evidence.\nSource Credibility (If Applicable): If a source is cited, is it generally considered reliable and unbiased? If not, explain why this weakens the evidence.\nEvaluate the effectiveness of each side's rebuttals within the clash. Define \"effectiveness\" as:\nDirect Response: Does the rebuttal directly address the opponent's claim and evidence?  If not, explain how this weakens the rebuttal.\nUndermining: Does the rebuttal successfully weaken the opponent's argument (e.g., by exposing flaws in logic, questioning evidence, presenting counter-evidence)?  Explain how the undermining occurs.\nExplicitly state which side wins the clash and why, referencing your analysis of logic, evidence, and rebuttals. Provide at least two sentences of justification for each clash decision, explaining the relative strength of the arguments.\nTrack the evolution of arguments through the debate within each clash. How did the claims and responses change over time? Note any significant shifts or concessions.\nArgument Hierarchy and Impact:\nIdentify the core arguments of each side (the foundational claims upon which their entire case rests).\nExplain the logical links between each core argument and its supporting claims/evidence. Are the links clear, direct, and strong?  If not, explain why this weakens the argument.\nAssess the stated or clearly implied impacts of each argument. What are the consequences if the argument is true? Be specific.\nDetermine the relative importance of each core argument to the overall debate. Which arguments are most central to resolving the motion? State this explicitly and justify your ranking.\nWeighing Principled vs. Practical Arguments: When weighing principled arguments (based on abstract concepts like rights or justice) against practical arguments (based on real-world consequences), consider:\n(a) the strength and universality of the underlying principle;\n(b) the directness, strength, and specificity of the evidence supporting the practical claims; and\n(c) the extent to which the practical arguments directly address, mitigate, or outweigh the concerns raised by the principled arguments.  Explain your reasoning.\nConsistency and Contradictions:\nIdentify any internal contradictions within each team's case (arguments that contradict each other).\nIdentify any inconsistencies between a team's arguments and their rebuttals.\nNote any dropped arguments (claims made but not responded to). For each dropped argument:\nAssess its initial strength based on its logical validity and supporting evidence, as if it had not been dropped.\nThen, consider the impact of it being unaddressed. Does the lack of response significantly weaken the overall case of the side that dropped it? Explain why or why not.\nII. Evaluation Requirements:\nSteelmanning: When analyzing arguments, present them in their strongest possible form, even if you disagree with them. Actively look for the most charitable interpretation.\nArgument-Based Decision: Base your decision solely on the arguments made within the debate text provided. Do not introduce outside knowledge or opinions.  If an argument relies on an unstated assumption, analyze it only if that assumption is clearly and necessarily implied by the presented arguments.\nIgnore Presentation: Disregard presentation style, speaking quality, rhetorical flourishes, etc. Focus exclusively on the substance of the arguments and their logical connections.\nFramework Neutrality: If both sides present valid but competing frameworks for evaluating the debate, maintain neutrality between them. Judge the debate based on how well each side argues within their chosen framework, and according to the prioritized criteria in Section I.\nIII. Common Judging Errors to AVOID:\nIntervention: Do not introduce your own arguments or evidence.\nShifting the Burden of Proof: Do not place a higher burden of proof on one side than the other. Both sides must prove their claims to the same standard.\nOver-reliance on \"Real-World\" Arguments: Do not automatically favor arguments based on \"real-world\" examples over principled or theoretical arguments. Evaluate all arguments based on the criteria in Section I.\nIgnoring Dropped Arguments: Address all dropped arguments as specified in I.3.\nDouble-Counting: Do not give credit for the same argument multiple times.\nAssuming Causation from Correlation: Be highly skeptical of arguments that claim causation based solely on correlation. Demand clear evidence of a causal mechanism.\nNot Justifying Clash Decisions: Provide explicit justification for every clash decision, as required in I.1.\nIV. Decision Making:\nWinner: The winner must be either \"Proposition\" or \"Opposition\" (no ties).\nConfidence Level: Assign a confidence level (0-100) reflecting the margin of victory. A score near 50 indicates a very close debate.\n90-100: Decisive Victory\n70-89: Clear Victory\n51-69: Narrow Victory.\nExplain why you assigned the specific confidence level.\nKey Factors: Identify the 2-3 most crucial factors that determined the outcome. These should be specific clashes or arguments that had the greatest impact on your decision. Explain why these factors were decisive.\nDetailed Reasoning: Provide a clear, logical, and detailed explanation for your conclusion. Explain how the key factors interacted to produce the result. Reference specific arguments and analysis from sections I-III. Show your work, step-by-step. Do not simply state your conclusion; justify it with reference to the specific arguments made.\nV. Line-by-Line Justification:\nCreate a section titled \"V. Line-by-Line Justification.\"\nIn this section, provide at least one sentence referencing each and every section of the provided debate text (Prop 1, Opp 1, Prop Rebuttal 1, Opp Rebuttal 1, Prop Final, Opp Final). This ensures that no argument, however minor, goes unaddressed. You may group multiple minor arguments together in a single sentence if they are closely related. The purpose is to demonstrate that you have considered the entirety of the debate.\nVI. Format for your response:\nOrganize your response in clearly marked sections exactly corresponding to the sections above (I.1, I.2, I.3, II, III, IV, V). This structured output is mandatory. Your response must follow this format to be accepted.\n\n\n\nformat:\nwrite all your thoughts out\nthen put in XML tags\n<winnerName>opposition|proposition</winnerName> \\n        <confidence>0-100</confidence>\\n\n\nThese existing is compulsory as the parser will fail otherwise\n"

      "opening": "**OPENING SPEECH STRUCTURE**\n\n**ARGUMENT 1**  \n**Core Claim:** Limiting individual shareholding to 15% voting rights in large social media platforms ensures democratic governance and reduces the risk of unilateral decision-making.  \n**Support Type:** Principle  \n**Support Details:**  \n- The principle of democratic governance emphasizes the importance of diverse stakeholder representation in decision-making processes. Concentrated private control undermines this principle by allowing a single individual or entity to dictate platform policies that impact millions of users.  \n- This principle is particularly valid in the context of social media, where platforms serve as public spaces for discourse and information sharing. Allowing broader institutional and public ownership ensures that decisions reflect a wider range of perspectives, promoting fairness and accountability.  \n- For example, the current model of concentrated control has led to arbitrary content moderation decisions, such as the deplatforming of certain voices without transparent criteria. Democratic ownership would mitigate such issues by involving multiple stakeholders in governance.  \n**Connection:** By limiting individual shareholding, we uphold the principle of democratic governance, ensuring that decisions in social media platforms are made collectively rather than unilaterally, thus protecting the public interest.  \n\n---\n\n**ARGUMENT 2**  \n**Core Claim:** Limiting individual shareholding reduces the risk of monopolistic practices and promotes competition in the social media industry.  \n**Support Type:** Evidence  \n**Support Details:**  \n- The current concentration of control in social media platforms has led to monopolistic behavior. For instance, Facebook (now Meta) acquired Instagram and WhatsApp to eliminate competition, which stifled innovation and limited user choice.  \n- A 2019 report by the U.S. House Judiciary Committee found that Facebook\u2019s monopolistic practices harmed consumers and competitors alike.  \n- By mandating broader ownership, new entrants and smaller platforms would have a fairer chance to compete, driving innovation and improving user experience.  \n**Connection:** This evidence demonstrates that concentrated ownership enables monopolistic practices, whereas limiting individual shareholding fosters competition and innovation in the social media sector.  \n\n---\n\n**ARGUMENT 3 (Optional)**  \n**Core Claim:** Broader ownership mitigates the societal risks posed by platforms with significant influence over public discourse.  \n**Support Type:** Principle  \n**Support Details:**  \n- Social media platforms with over 100 million users wield immense power over public opinion and societal norms. Concentrated control in such platforms poses risks like misinformation, polarization, and manipulation.  \n- The principle of accountability holds that entities with significant societal impact must be subject to checks and balances. Broader ownership ensures that no single entity can exploit this power unchecked.  \n- For example, the Cambridge Analytica scandal highlighted how concentrated control could lead to unethical data practices that manipulated public opinion. A diverse ownership structure would prevent such abuses by distributing oversight.  \n**Connection:** By limiting individual shareholding, we enforce accountability and reduce the societal risks associated with concentrated control in influential social media platforms.  \n\n---\n\n**SYNTHESIS**  \nThese arguments work together to demonstrate that limiting individual shareholding in large social media platforms is essential for democratic governance, competition, and societal accountability. Together, they prove that concentrated private control undermines fairness, innovation, and public trust. Implementing this policy would ensure that social media platforms serve the public interest rather than the interests of a few individuals, creating a healthier digital ecosystem.  \n\n---\n\n",
      "rebuttal": "REBUTTAL STRUCTURE\n\nCLASH POINT 1  \nOriginal Claim: \"Concentrated ownership in social media platforms ensures decisive leadership, which is necessary for rapid innovation and effective content moderation.\"  \nChallenge Type: Evidence Critique  \nChallenge:  \n- The evidence provided is selective and ignores the negative consequences of concentrated ownership. While Meta\u2019s acquisitions of Instagram and WhatsApp were strategic, they were also anti-competitive, as highlighted by the U.S. House Judiciary Committee\u2019s 2019 report. This undermines the claim that concentrated ownership fosters innovation, as it often stifles competition.  \n- Twitter\u2019s restructuring under Elon Musk\u2019s concentrated control has been widely criticized for erratic decision-making, such as the rushed rollout of Twitter Blue, which led to widespread impersonation and platform instability. This shows that concentrated ownership can lead to reckless, rather than effective, decision-making.  \nImpact: Winning this point is crucial because it dismantles the opposition\u2019s core claim that concentrated ownership is necessary for innovation and effective governance, showing instead that it can lead to anti-competitive behavior and poor decision-making.  \n\n---\n\nCLASH POINT 2  \nOriginal Claim: \"Broadening ownership to institutional and public shareholders introduces inefficiencies and short-term profit motives that harm platform stability and user experience.\"  \nChallenge Type: Counter Principle  \nChallenge:  \n- The principle of democratic governance inherently includes mechanisms to balance short-term profit motives with long-term platform health. For example, diversified ownership can include stakeholders like public interest groups, which prioritize user welfare over profit.  \n- The opposition\u2019s claim assumes that institutional investors are inherently short-termist, but this is not universally true. Many institutional investors, such as pension funds, have long-term horizons and prioritize sustainable growth.  \nImpact: This point is critical because it refutes the opposition\u2019s assumption that broader ownership necessarily leads to inefficiencies, showing instead that it can create a more balanced and accountable governance structure.  \n\n---\n\nCLASH POINT 3  \nOriginal Claim: \"Mandating diluted ownership undermines private property rights and creates a dangerous precedent for government overreach in tech regulation.\"  \nChallenge Type: Principle Critique  \nChallenge:  \n- The principle of private property rights is not absolute and must be balanced against the public interest, especially in industries with significant societal impact. Social media platforms with over 100 million users are akin to public utilities, where regulation is justified to protect the public good.  \n- The slippery slope argument is unfounded. This policy is narrowly tailored to address the unique risks posed by concentrated control in social media platforms, not a blanket regulation across all industries.  \nImpact: Winning this point is essential because it demonstrates that the policy is a justified and targeted intervention to protect the public interest, not an overreach of government power.  \n\n---\n\nDEFENSIVE ANALYSIS  \nVulnerabilities:  \n- The opposition may argue that our evidence on Twitter\u2019s instability under Musk is anecdotal and not representative of all cases.  \n- They may also claim that our counter-principle on institutional investors is speculative without concrete examples.  \nAdditional Support:  \n- We can reinforce our argument with data from the U.S. House Judiciary Committee\u2019s report on Facebook\u2019s anti-competitive practices.  \n- We can cite examples of successful diversified ownership models in other industries, such as public utilities, to show that broader ownership can work effectively.  \nWhy We Prevail:  \n- Our arguments directly address the opposition\u2019s claims with specific evidence and principles, showing that concentrated ownership is not necessary for innovation and can be harmful.  \n- We provide a balanced view of broader ownership, demonstrating its potential to create more accountable and fair governance.  \n\n---\n\nWEIGHING  \nKey Clash Points:  \n- The most important disagreements are on the necessity of concentrated ownership for innovation and the risks of broader ownership.  \nWhy We Win:  \n- We have shown that concentrated ownership often leads to anti-competitive behavior and poor decision-making, while broader ownership can create a more balanced governance structure.  \nOverall Impact:  \n- Winning these key points proves that limiting individual shareholding is essential for promoting competition, accountability, and the public interest in social media platforms.  \n\n",
      "closing": "**FINAL SPEECH STRUCTURE**\n\n**FRAMING**  \n**Core Questions:**  \n1. Should social media platforms with over 100 million users be governed democratically or by concentrated private control?  \n2. Does concentrated ownership enable innovation and accountability, or does it lead to monopolistic practices and societal risks?  \n3. Is the proposed policy a justified intervention to protect the public interest, or does it undermine private property rights and innovation?  \n\n**Key Decisions:**  \n- The debate hinges on whether the benefits of democratic governance and competition outweigh the risks of inefficiency and regulatory overreach.  \n- The judge must evaluate the societal impact of concentrated control versus broader ownership in shaping public discourse and platform behavior.  \n\n**Evaluation Framework:**  \nThe debate should be evaluated based on:  \n1. The strength of principles (democratic governance vs. private property rights).  \n2. The quality of evidence (real-world examples of concentrated vs. diversified ownership).  \n3. The logical validity of arguments (causal links between ownership structure and outcomes).  \n\n---\n\n**KEY CLASHES**  \n\n**Clash 1: Democratic Governance vs. Corporate Agility**  \n**Quote:** \"Democratic governance in corporations often leads to gridlock and indecision, as seen in Twitter\u2019s pre-Musk era.\"  \n**Our Case Strength:**  \n- Democratic governance ensures that decisions reflect diverse stakeholder interests, reducing the risk of unilateral actions that harm the public.  \n- The opposition\u2019s example of Twitter\u2019s pre-Musk stagnation ignores the reckless decision-making under Musk\u2019s concentrated control, such as the Twitter Blue rollout.  \n**Their Response Gaps:**  \n- They conflate corporate agility with effective governance. Agility without accountability leads to harmful outcomes, as seen in the Cambridge Analytica scandal.  \n- They fail to address how democratic governance can be structured to avoid gridlock, such as through stakeholder representation.  \n**Crucial Impact:**  \nThis clash is central to the motion because it determines whether social media platforms should prioritize public accountability or private control.  \n\n---\n\n**Clash 2: Monopolistic Practices and Competition**  \n**Quote:** \"The acquisition of Instagram and WhatsApp by Facebook was not solely a result of concentrated ownership but a strategic move to integrate complementary services.\"  \n**Our Case Strength:**  \n- The U.S. House Judiciary Committee\u2019s report explicitly links Facebook\u2019s acquisitions to anti-competitive practices, showing how concentrated ownership enables monopolistic behavior.  \n- Limiting individual shareholding would prevent such acquisitions, fostering a more competitive market.  \n**Their Response Gaps:**  \n- They dismiss the causal link between ownership concentration and monopolistic practices without providing counter-evidence.  \n- They ignore the broader trend of tech giants using acquisitions to stifle competition.  \n**Crucial Impact:**  \nThis clash is critical because it shows that concentrated ownership harms competition, while broader ownership promotes innovation and user choice.  \n\n---\n\n**Clash 3: Societal Risks and Accountability**  \n**Quote:** \"Concentrated ownership allows founders/CEOs to prioritize long-term vision and user welfare over short-term profits.\"  \n**Our Case Strength:**  \n- Broader ownership ensures that societal risks, such as misinformation and data exploitation, are addressed through diverse oversight.  \n- The opposition\u2019s example of Zuckerberg\u2019s focus on the metaverse ignores the societal harms caused by Facebook\u2019s algorithms and data practices.  \n**Their Response Gaps:**  \n- They fail to explain how concentrated ownership prevents abuses like the Cambridge Analytica scandal.  \n- They assume that institutional investors are inherently short-termist, ignoring examples of long-term-focused investors.  \n**Crucial Impact:**  \nThis clash is vital because it demonstrates that broader ownership is necessary to mitigate the societal risks posed by platforms with significant influence over public discourse.  \n\n---\n\n**VOTING ISSUES**  \n\n**Priority Analysis:**  \n1. Democratic governance vs. corporate agility: This is the most important clash because it determines the fundamental structure of platform governance.  \n2. Monopolistic practices and competition: This clash is critical for evaluating the policy\u2019s impact on innovation and user choice.  \n3. Societal risks and accountability: This clash is essential for assessing the policy\u2019s ability to protect the public interest.  \n\n**Case Proof:**  \n- Winning the first clash proves that democratic governance is necessary to ensure accountability and fairness in platform decision-making.  \n- Winning the second clash demonstrates that limiting individual shareholding promotes competition and innovation.  \n- Winning the third clash shows that broader ownership mitigates societal risks and protects public discourse.  \n\n**Final Weighing:**  \n- The opposition\u2019s arguments rely on selective examples and flawed principles, while our case is supported by robust evidence and logical reasoning.  \n- The societal benefits of democratic governance, competition, and accountability outweigh the risks of inefficiency and regulatory overreach.  \n\n---\n\n**Conclusion:**  \nThe proposition has proven that limiting individual shareholding in social media platforms with over 100 million users is essential for promoting democratic governance, fostering competition, and mitigating societal risks. The opposition\u2019s arguments fail to address the harms of concentrated control and the benefits of broader ownership. We urge the judge to vote Proposition.  \n\n"

      "opening": "**OPENING SPEECH STRUCTURE**  \n\n**ARGUMENT 1**  \n**Core Claim:** Concentrated ownership in social media platforms ensures decisive leadership, which is necessary for rapid innovation and effective content moderation.  \n**Support Type:** EVIDENCE  \n**Support Details:**  \n- Facebook (now Meta) under Mark Zuckerberg\u2019s majority control (voting rights ~58%) has been able to make swift strategic pivots, such as the acquisitions of Instagram (2012) and WhatsApp (2014), which were critical to its growth and ability to compete globally.  \n- Twitter\u2019s struggles with indecision under dispersed ownership (pre-Elon Musk) led to stagnation in product development and policy enforcement, whereas Musk\u2019s concentrated control allowed for rapid restructuring and feature rollouts (e.g., Twitter Blue, algorithmic changes).  \n**Connection:** These examples demonstrate that concentrated voting rights enable faster decision-making, which is essential for platforms operating in a highly dynamic and competitive digital landscape. Without decisive leadership, social media companies risk falling behind competitors or failing to adapt to regulatory and user demands.  \n\n---  \n\n**ARGUMENT 2**  \n**Core Claim:** Broadening ownership to institutional and public shareholders introduces inefficiencies and short-term profit motives that harm platform stability and user experience.  \n**Support Type:** PRINCIPLE  \n**Support Details:**  \n- Institutional investors (e.g., hedge funds, pension funds) prioritize quarterly earnings over long-term platform health, often pushing for cost-cutting measures that degrade content moderation and security (e.g., layoffs in trust & safety teams).  \n- Publicly traded companies face pressure to maximize ad revenue, leading to engagement-driven algorithms that amplify polarizing content\u2014a problem seen in YouTube\u2019s and Facebook\u2019s struggles with misinformation.  \n**Connection:** Dispersed ownership fragments accountability and incentivizes profit-maximizing behaviors that conflict with user welfare. Concentrated ownership, by contrast, allows founders/CEOs to balance profitability with mission-driven governance (e.g., Zuckerberg\u2019s focus on the metaverse despite shareholder skepticism).  \n\n---  \n\n**ARGUMENT 3**  \n**Core Claim:** Mandating diluted ownership undermines private property rights and creates a dangerous precedent for government overreach in tech regulation.  \n**Support Type:** PRINCIPLE  \n**Support Details:**  \n- Forcing shareholders to relinquish voting rights is a form of expropriation that discourages investment in tech innovation. Startups rely on the promise of control to attract venture capital; retroactive limits would chill funding.  \n- If applied beyond social media, such policies could extend to other industries, creating uncertainty for entrepreneurs and investors (e.g., Tesla, SpaceX).  \n**Connection:** This policy sets a slippery slope where governments can arbitrarily redistribute corporate control, violating foundational economic principles and stifling the risk-taking that drives technological progress.  \n\n---  \n\n**SYNTHESIS**  \nThese arguments form a cohesive case: concentrated ownership enables agility and mission-aligned governance, whereas forced dilution introduces harmful inefficiencies and regulatory overreach. The examples of Meta and Twitter prove that decisive leadership is critical for platform success, while the principles of property rights and investor incentives highlight the broader economic dangers of this policy.

      "rebuttal": "**REBUTTAL STRUCTURE**\n\n**CLASH POINT 1**  \n**Original Claim:** \"Limiting individual shareholding to 15% voting rights in large social media platforms ensures democratic governance and reduces the risk of unilateral decision-making.\"  \n**Challenge Type:** Principle Critique  \n**Challenge:**  \nThe principle of democratic governance, while appealing, is fundamentally flawed when applied to corporate structures. Social media platforms are not governments; they are private enterprises designed to innovate and compete in a market. Applying democratic governance principles to corporations conflates public institutions with private entities, leading to inefficiencies and misaligned incentives.  \n- **Limitation 1:** Democratic governance in corporations often leads to gridlock and indecision, as seen in Twitter\u2019s pre-Musk era, where dispersed ownership resulted in stagnation.  \n- **Limitation 2:** Corporations thrive on decisive leadership, not consensus-building. The proposition\u2019s principle fails to account for the need for agility in a fast-paced industry.  \n- **Limitation 3:** The principle assumes that broader ownership inherently leads to better decisions, but it ignores the risk of conflicting interests among stakeholders, which can paralyze decision-making.  \n**Impact:** Winning this point is crucial because it undermines the proposition\u2019s foundational principle, showing that democratic governance is ill-suited for corporate structures, especially in the tech industry.  \n\n---\n\n**CLASH POINT 2**  \n**Original Claim:** \"Limiting individual shareholding reduces the risk of monopolistic practices and promotes competition in the social media industry.\"  \n**Challenge Type:** Evidence Critique  \n**Challenge:**  \nThe evidence provided by the proposition is incomplete and misrepresents the role of ownership concentration in monopolistic practices.  \n- **Flaw 1:** The acquisition of Instagram and WhatsApp by Facebook was not solely a result of concentrated ownership but a strategic move to integrate complementary services. These acquisitions were approved by regulatory bodies, indicating they were not inherently anti-competitive.  \n- **Flaw 2:** The U.S. House Judiciary Committee\u2019s report on Facebook\u2019s monopolistic practices does not establish a causal link between ownership concentration and anti-competitive behavior. The report focuses on business practices, not ownership structure.  \n- **Flaw 3:** Limiting individual shareholding does not guarantee increased competition. Smaller platforms often struggle due to network effects and economies of scale, not ownership structure.  \n**Impact:** This critique dismantles the proposition\u2019s evidence, showing that ownership concentration is not the root cause of monopolistic practices and that the proposed policy would not effectively promote competition.  \n\n---\n\n**CLASH POINT 3**  \n**Original Claim:** \"Broader ownership mitigates the societal risks posed by platforms with significant influence over public discourse.\"  \n**Challenge Type:** Counter Principle  \n**Challenge:**  \nThe principle of accountability through broader ownership is outweighed by the principle of mission-aligned governance under concentrated ownership.  \n- **Counter Principle:** Concentrated ownership allows founders/CEOs to prioritize long-term vision and user welfare over short-term profits, as seen in Zuckerberg\u2019s focus on the metaverse despite shareholder skepticism.  \n- **Superiority:** Broader ownership introduces conflicting interests, such as institutional investors prioritizing quarterly earnings, which can lead to harmful practices like engagement-driven algorithms that amplify misinformation.  \n- **Application:** The Cambridge Analytica scandal was a failure of oversight, not ownership structure. Broader ownership would not necessarily prevent such abuses, as institutional investors often lack the expertise or incentive to address complex ethical issues.  \n**Impact:** This counter principle demonstrates that concentrated ownership is better suited to address societal risks by aligning governance with long-term user welfare, undermining the proposition\u2019s claim.  \n\n---\n\n**DEFENSIVE ANALYSIS**  \n**Vulnerabilities:**  \n- The opposition\u2019s reliance on examples like Meta and Twitter could be challenged if the proposition argues that these platforms\u2019 issues stem from concentrated ownership.  \n- The principle critique of democratic governance could be countered by arguing that social media platforms are de facto public spaces, warranting public oversight.  \n**Additional Support:**  \n- Reinforce the point that concentrated ownership enables rapid adaptation to regulatory changes, a critical advantage in the tech industry.  \n- Highlight that broader ownership could lead to regulatory capture, where institutional investors lobby for policies that benefit their interests over users\u2019.  \n**Why We Prevail:**  \nThe opposition\u2019s arguments are more aligned with the realities of corporate governance and the tech industry. The proposition\u2019s principles and evidence are either misapplied or insufficient to justify the proposed policy.  \n\n---\n\n**WEIGHING**  \n**Key Clash Points:**  \n1. The applicability of democratic governance to corporate structures.  \n2. The causal link between ownership concentration and monopolistic practices.  \n3. The effectiveness of broader ownership in mitigating societal risks.  \n**Why We Win:**  \nThe opposition\u2019s critiques and counter principles directly address the proposition\u2019s core claims, showing that concentrated ownership is essential for innovation, agility, and mission-aligned governance. The proposition\u2019s arguments fail to account for the trade-offs and unintended consequences of their policy.  \n**Overall Impact:**  \nWinning these key points demonstrates that the motion is based on flawed principles and evidence, and that the proposed policy would harm the tech ecosystem and user welfare.  \n\n",
      "closing": "### FINAL SPEECH STRUCTURE  \n\n#### FRAMING  \n**Core Questions:**  \n1. Is democratic governance applicable to private corporations like social media platforms?  \n2. Does concentrated ownership inherently lead to monopolistic practices?  \n3. Does broader ownership effectively mitigate societal risks posed by social media platforms?  \n\n**Key Decisions:**  \n- The debate hinges on whether the proposed policy aligns with the realities of corporate governance and the tech industry.  \n- The evaluation should focus on the trade-offs between agility, innovation, and accountability.  \n\n**Evaluation Framework:**  \nThe judge should weigh the opposition\u2019s arguments on the necessity of concentrated ownership for innovation and mission-aligned governance against the proposition\u2019s claims of democratic governance and reduced monopolistic practices.  \n\n---\n\n#### KEY CLASHES  \n\n**Clash 1: Democratic Governance in Corporations**  \n**Quote:** \"The principle of democratic governance, while appealing, is fundamentally flawed when applied to corporate structures.\"  \n**Our Case Strength:**  \n- Corporations are not governments; they require decisive leadership to innovate and compete.  \n- Examples like Twitter\u2019s stagnation under dispersed ownership and Meta\u2019s agility under Zuckerberg\u2019s control demonstrate the need for concentrated ownership.  \n**Their Response Gaps:**  \n- The proposition conflates public institutions with private enterprises, ignoring the unique needs of the tech industry.  \n- They fail to address the inefficiencies and gridlock that democratic governance can introduce in corporate settings.  \n**Crucial Impact:**  \nThis clash is central to the debate because it challenges the proposition\u2019s foundational principle, showing that democratic governance is ill-suited for social media platforms.  \n\n---\n\n**Clash 2: Ownership Concentration and Monopolistic Practices**  \n**Quote:** \"The evidence provided by the proposition is incomplete and misrepresents the role of ownership concentration in monopolistic practices.\"  \n**Our Case Strength:**  \n- The acquisitions of Instagram and WhatsApp were strategic moves, not solely a result of concentrated ownership.  \n- The U.S. House Judiciary Committee\u2019s report focuses on business practices, not ownership structure.  \n**Their Response Gaps:**  \n- The proposition fails to establish a causal link between ownership concentration and anti-competitive behavior.  \n- They ignore the role of network effects and economies of scale in monopolistic practices.  \n**Crucial Impact:**  \nThis clash dismantles the proposition\u2019s evidence, showing that the proposed policy would not effectively promote competition.  \n\n---\n\n**Clash 3: Broader Ownership and Societal Risks**  \n**Quote:** \"The principle of accountability through broader ownership is outweighed by the principle of mission-aligned governance under concentrated ownership.\"  \n**Our Case Strength:**  \n- Concentrated ownership allows founders/CEOs to prioritize long-term vision and user welfare, as seen in Zuckerberg\u2019s focus on the metaverse.  \n- Broader ownership introduces conflicting interests, such as institutional investors prioritizing short-term profits.  \n**Their Response Gaps:**  \n- The proposition assumes broader ownership inherently leads to better decisions, ignoring the risk of conflicting interests.  \n- They fail to address how broader ownership could lead to regulatory capture.  \n**Crucial Impact:**  \nThis clash demonstrates that concentrated ownership is better suited to address societal risks, undermining the proposition\u2019s claim.  \n\n---\n\n#### VOTING ISSUES  \n\n**Priority Analysis:**  \n1. The applicability of democratic governance to corporate structures is the most critical clash, as it challenges the proposition\u2019s foundational principle.  \n2. The causal link between ownership concentration and monopolistic practices is also crucial, as it directly addresses the proposition\u2019s evidence.  \n3. The effectiveness of broader ownership in mitigating societal risks is important but secondary to the first two clashes.  \n\n**Case Proof:**  \n- Winning Clash 1 shows that democratic governance is ill-suited for social media platforms, undermining the proposition\u2019s core argument.  \n- Winning Clash 2 dismantles the proposition\u2019s evidence on monopolistic practices, showing that the proposed policy would not promote competition.  \n- Winning Clash 3 demonstrates that concentrated ownership is better suited to address societal risks, further weakening the proposition\u2019s case.  \n\n**Final Weighing:**  \nThe opposition\u2019s arguments are more aligned with the realities of corporate governance and the tech industry. The proposition\u2019s principles and evidence are either misapplied or insufficient to justify the proposed policy.  \n\n---\n\n"
