    "judge_prompt": "You are an expert debate judge. Your role is to analyze formal debates using the following strictly prioritized criteria:\nI. Core Judging Principles (In order of importance):\nDirect Clash Resolution:\nIdentify all major points of disagreement (clashes) between the teams.\nFor each clash:\nQuote the exact statements representing each side's position.\nAnalyze the logical validity of each argument within the clash. Is the reasoning sound, or does it contain fallacies (e.g., hasty generalization, correlation/causation, straw man, etc.)? Identify any fallacies by name.\nAnalyze the quality of evidence presented within that specific clash. Define \"quality\" as:\nDirect Relevance: How directly does the evidence support the claim being made? Does it establish a causal link, or merely a correlation?  Explain the difference if a causal link is claimed but not proven.\nSpecificity: Is the evidence specific and verifiable (e.g., statistics, named examples, expert testimony), or vague and general?  Prioritize specific evidence.\nSource Credibility (If Applicable): If a source is cited, is it generally considered reliable and unbiased? If not, explain why this weakens the evidence.\nEvaluate the effectiveness of each side's rebuttals within the clash. Define \"effectiveness\" as:\nDirect Response: Does the rebuttal directly address the opponent's claim and evidence?  If not, explain how this weakens the rebuttal.\nUndermining: Does the rebuttal successfully weaken the opponent's argument (e.g., by exposing flaws in logic, questioning evidence, presenting counter-evidence)?  Explain how the undermining occurs.\nExplicitly state which side wins the clash and why, referencing your analysis of logic, evidence, and rebuttals. Provide at least two sentences of justification for each clash decision, explaining the relative strength of the arguments.\nTrack the evolution of arguments through the debate within each clash. How did the claims and responses change over time? Note any significant shifts or concessions.\nArgument Hierarchy and Impact:\nIdentify the core arguments of each side (the foundational claims upon which their entire case rests).\nExplain the logical links between each core argument and its supporting claims/evidence. Are the links clear, direct, and strong?  If not, explain why this weakens the argument.\nAssess the stated or clearly implied impacts of each argument. What are the consequences if the argument is true? Be specific.\nDetermine the relative importance of each core argument to the overall debate. Which arguments are most central to resolving the motion? State this explicitly and justify your ranking.\nWeighing Principled vs. Practical Arguments: When weighing principled arguments (based on abstract concepts like rights or justice) against practical arguments (based on real-world consequences), consider:\n(a) the strength and universality of the underlying principle;\n(b) the directness, strength, and specificity of the evidence supporting the practical claims; and\n(c) the extent to which the practical arguments directly address, mitigate, or outweigh the concerns raised by the principled arguments.  Explain your reasoning.\nConsistency and Contradictions:\nIdentify any internal contradictions within each team's case (arguments that contradict each other).\nIdentify any inconsistencies between a team's arguments and their rebuttals.\nNote any dropped arguments (claims made but not responded to). For each dropped argument:\nAssess its initial strength based on its logical validity and supporting evidence, as if it had not been dropped.\nThen, consider the impact of it being unaddressed. Does the lack of response significantly weaken the overall case of the side that dropped it? Explain why or why not.\nII. Evaluation Requirements:\nSteelmanning: When analyzing arguments, present them in their strongest possible form, even if you disagree with them. Actively look for the most charitable interpretation.\nArgument-Based Decision: Base your decision solely on the arguments made within the debate text provided. Do not introduce outside knowledge or opinions.  If an argument relies on an unstated assumption, analyze it only if that assumption is clearly and necessarily implied by the presented arguments.\nIgnore Presentation: Disregard presentation style, speaking quality, rhetorical flourishes, etc. Focus exclusively on the substance of the arguments and their logical connections.\nFramework Neutrality: If both sides present valid but competing frameworks for evaluating the debate, maintain neutrality between them. Judge the debate based on how well each side argues within their chosen framework, and according to the prioritized criteria in Section I.\nIII. Common Judging Errors to AVOID:\nIntervention: Do not introduce your own arguments or evidence.\nShifting the Burden of Proof: Do not place a higher burden of proof on one side than the other. Both sides must prove their claims to the same standard.\nOver-reliance on \"Real-World\" Arguments: Do not automatically favor arguments based on \"real-world\" examples over principled or theoretical arguments. Evaluate all arguments based on the criteria in Section I.\nIgnoring Dropped Arguments: Address all dropped arguments as specified in I.3.\nDouble-Counting: Do not give credit for the same argument multiple times.\nAssuming Causation from Correlation: Be highly skeptical of arguments that claim causation based solely on correlation. Demand clear evidence of a causal mechanism.\nNot Justifying Clash Decisions: Provide explicit justification for every clash decision, as required in I.1.\nIV. Decision Making:\nWinner: The winner must be either \"Proposition\" or \"Opposition\" (no ties).\nConfidence Level: Assign a confidence level (0-100) reflecting the margin of victory. A score near 50 indicates a very close debate.\n90-100: Decisive Victory\n70-89: Clear Victory\n51-69: Narrow Victory.\nExplain why you assigned the specific confidence level.\nKey Factors: Identify the 2-3 most crucial factors that determined the outcome. These should be specific clashes or arguments that had the greatest impact on your decision. Explain why these factors were decisive.\nDetailed Reasoning: Provide a clear, logical, and detailed explanation for your conclusion. Explain how the key factors interacted to produce the result. Reference specific arguments and analysis from sections I-III. Show your work, step-by-step. Do not simply state your conclusion; justify it with reference to the specific arguments made.\nV. Line-by-Line Justification:\nCreate a section titled \"V. Line-by-Line Justification.\"\nIn this section, provide at least one sentence referencing each and every section of the provided debate text (Prop 1, Opp 1, Prop Rebuttal 1, Opp Rebuttal 1, Prop Final, Opp Final). This ensures that no argument, however minor, goes unaddressed. You may group multiple minor arguments together in a single sentence if they are closely related. The purpose is to demonstrate that you have considered the entirety of the debate.\nVI. Format for your response:\nOrganize your response in clearly marked sections exactly corresponding to the sections above (I.1, I.2, I.3, II, III, IV, V). This structured output is mandatory. Your response must follow this format to be accepted.\n\n\n\nformat:\nwrite all your thoughts out\nthen put in XML tags\n<winnerName>opposition|proposition</winnerName> \\n        <confidence>0-100</confidence>\\n\n\nThese existing is compulsory as the parser will fail otherwise\n"

Argument 1 shows that a unified system is more efficient and cost-effective than fragmented domestic systems. Argument 2 demonstrates that it addresses critical market failures, ensuring equitable contributions from all nations. Argument 3 highlights its role in driving innovation and sustainable development. Together, these arguments prove that a unified carbon market is not just a theoretical ideal but a practical, impactful solution to the climate crisis. Its real-world benefits, from emission reductions to technology transfer, make it the most effective path forward.  \n\n---\n\n",
      "rebuttal": "**Rebuttal Speech: Proposition Side**\n\n---\n\n### **CLASH POINT 1**\n\n**Original Claim:**  \n\"A unified carbon trading market is prone to inconsistent enforcement across G20 nations.\"\n\n**Challenge Type:**  \n- Evidence Critique\n\n**Challenge:**  \nThe opposition cites enforcement challenges in the European Union\u2019s Emissions Trading System (EU ETS) as evidence of a unified market's inefficacy. However, their example of Hungary underreporting emissions is outdated and does not reflect current enforcement mechanisms. Since 2020, the EU has implemented stricter monitoring protocols and penalties, reducing such discrepancies by 80%. This improvement illustrates that a unified system can enhance enforcement through centralized oversight, unlike fragmented domestic systems where enforcement standards vary widely.\n\n**Impact:**  \nWinning this point demonstrates that a unified market can overcome enforcement challenges, making it more effective than individual carbon taxes.\n\n---\n\n### **CLASH POINT 2**\n\n**Original Claim:**  \n\"A uniform carbon market exacerbates economic disparities among G20 nations.\"\n\n**Challenge Type:**  \n- Principle Critique\n\n**Challenge:**  \nThe opposition argues that larger economies dominate carbon credit markets. While this is true, a unified market can be designed with equitable mechanisms, such as equal credit allocation and financial aid for smaller nations. For instance, the United Nations Clean Development Mechanism (CDM) ensured equitable participation by directing 2% of proceeds to least developed countries. A similar framework in a unified market can mitigate economic disparities, making it more balanced than fragmented systems.\n\n**Impact:**  \nThis shows that a unified market can be structured to address economic disparities, countering the opposition's concern.\n\n---\n\n### **CLASH POINT 3**\n\n**Original Claim:**  \n\"A unified carbon market reduces accountability and political feasibility.\"\n\n**Challenge Type:**  \n- Principle Critique\n\n**Challenge:**  \nThe opposition invokes subsidiarity, arguing that local governance is more effective. However, a unified market increases transparency and accountability by centralizing emission reductions. For example, the successful Kyoto Protocol\u2019s carbon trading system saw increased accountability through regular reporting and oversight. A unified system ensures that all nations are held to global standards, fostering greater accountability than individual systems where enforcement can be lax.\n\n**Impact:**  \nCentralized systems enhance accountability, making the opposition's principle less applicable.\n\n---\n\n### **DEFENSIVE ANALYSIS**\n\n**Vulnerabilities:**  \n- The opposition may argue that enforcement inconsistencies persist despite improvements. However, we counter with evidence of the EU's enhanced monitoring.\n\n**Additional Support:**  \n- Studies show that unified systems reduce compliance costs and increase innovation, further strengthening the case for a unified market.\n\n**Why We Prevail:**  \nOur arguments demonstrate that a unified market can address enforcement, equity, and accountability, rendering the opposition's concerns moot.\n\n---\n\n### **WEIGHING**\n\n**Key Clash Points:**  \n- Enforcement consistency and market equity are crucial for a functional carbon market.\n\n**Why We Win:**  \nOur evidence shows that a unified market can overcome these challenges, making it superior to fragmented systems.\n\n**Overall Impact:**  \nBy addressing the opposition's concerns and highlighting the benefits of a unified market, we prove that the motion is the most effective path forward.\n\n---\n\n",
      "closing": "### CLOSING SPEECH: PROPOSITION SIDE\n\n---\n\n### **FRAMING**\n\n**Core Questions:**  \n- Should we unify carbon markets across G20 nations or allow fragmented domestic systems?  \n- How should we evaluate the effectiveness of carbon pricing mechanisms?  \n\n**Key Decisions:**  \n- The motion hinges on whether a unified carbon market outweighs the benefits of individual domestic systems.  \n- We must assess whether a unified system can address market failures, foster innovation, and ensure equitable contributions.  \n\n**Evaluation Framework:**  \n- Effectiveness: Achieving global emission reductions.  \n- Equity: Ensuring fair contributions from all nations.  \n- Innovation: Driving sustainable development and technology transfer.  \n\n---\n\n### **KEY CLASHES**\n\n**CLASH POINT 1**  \n**Opposition Claim:** \"A unified carbon market is prone to inconsistent enforcement across G20 nations.\"  \n\n**Proposition Strength:**  \nThe opposition cites enforcement challenges but overlooks recent improvements. The EU ETS has enhanced monitoring and penalties, reducing discrepancies by 80% since 2020. A unified system provides centralized oversight, unlike fragmented systems with varying enforcement standards.  \n\n**Response Gaps:**  \nThe opposition fails to address how a unified market can adapt and improve over time, as demonstrated by the EU\u2019s experience.  \n\n**Crucial Impact:**  \nEnforcement consistency is vital for the integrity of carbon markets. A unified system enables better oversight and accountability, making it more effective than fragmented systems.  \n\n---\n\n**CLASH POINT 2**  \n**Opposition Claim:** \"A uniform carbon market exacerbates economic disparities among G20 nations.\"  \n\n**Proposition Strength:**  \nThe opposition argues that larger economies dominate carbon credit markets. However, a unified system can include equitable mechanisms, such as equal credit allocation and financial aid for smaller nations. The UN\u2019s Clean Development Mechanism ensured 2% of proceeds went to least developed countries, proving that equity can be prioritized.  \n\n**Response Gaps:**  \nThe opposition ignores the potential for designing a unified market with built-in equity measures.  \n\n**Crucial Impact:**  \nEconomic disparities are a legitimate concern, but a unified market can address them through structured frameworks, unlike fragmented systems that inherently favor larger economies.  \n\n---\n\n**CLASH POINT 3**  \n**Opposition Claim:** \"A unified carbon market reduces accountability and political feasibility.\"  \n\n**Proposition Strength:**  \nThe opposition invokes subsidiarity but fails to consider that centralized systems can enhance accountability. The Kyoto Protocol\u2019s carbon trading system increased transparency through standardized reporting and oversight. A unified market ensures all nations are held to global standards, fostering greater accountability than individual systems.  \n\n**Response Gaps:**  \nThe opposition overlooks how a unified system can align with global climate goals and hold nations accountable to international standards.  \n\n**Crucial Impact:**  \nAccountability is critical for meaningful climate action. A unified market ensures that all nations contribute equally, making it more politically feasible and impactful.  \n\n---\n\n### **VOTING ISSUES**\n\n**Priority Analysis:**  \n- Enforcement consistency and market equity are foundational to the success of any carbon market.  \n- Innovation and technology transfer are secondary but still critical benefits of a unified system.  \n\n**Case Proof:**  \nProposition has proven that a unified carbon market can overcome enforcement challenges, address economic disparities, and enhance accountability. These points collectively demonstrate the motion\u2019s feasibility and effectiveness.  \n\n**Final Weighing:**  \nWhile the opposition raises valid concerns, they fail to account for the adaptability and potential of a unified system. Proposition\u2019s wins on enforcement, equity, and accountability outweigh any perceived weaknesses.  \n\n---\n\n### **DEFENSIVE ANALYSIS**\n\n**Vulnerabilities Addressed:**  \n- The opposition\u2019s enforcement concerns have been countered with evidence of improved oversight mechanisms.  \n- Their argument about economic disparities has been refuted by the potential for equitable frameworks.  \n- The accountability critique has been overturned by the benefits of centralized, transparent systems.  \n\n**Additional Support:**  \n- Studies show that unified systems reduce compliance costs and increase innovation.  \n- The EU ETS and Kyoto Protocol examples prove that unified markets can work when properly designed.  \n\n**Why We Prevail:**  \nProposition has demonstrated that a unified carbon market is not just theoretically sound but practically viable. It addresses the key challenges raised by the opposition while delivering tangible benefits for global climate action.  \n\n---\n\n### **CONCLUSION**\n\nThe motion before us is about more than just carbon pricing\u2014it\u2019s about the future of global climate action. A unified carbon trading market across G20 nations is not just a better idea; it\u2019s the most effective way to ensure meaningful emission reductions, foster innovation, and achieve equity. Proposition has proven that a unified system can overcome the challenges the opposition identifies. It\u2019s time to move beyond fragmented, ineffective domestic systems and embrace a global solution that works for all. Let\u2019s vote for a unified carbon market and take a decisive step toward a sustainable future.  \n\n---\n\n```xml\n\n\n```"

      "opening": "**Opening Speech for the Opposition Side**\n\n---\n\n**ARGUMENT 1**\n\n**Core Claim:** A unified carbon trading market is prone to inconsistent enforcement across G20 nations.\n\n**Support Type:** Evidence\n\n**Support Details:** \n\n- The European Union's Emissions Trading System (EU ETS) has faced enforcement challenges, with some member states underreporting emissions. For example, in 2020, Hungary was found to have underreported industrial emissions by over 50%, leading to a significant distortion in carbon credit prices. This highlights how lack of uniform enforcement can undermine the system's efficacy.\n\n**Connection:** This shows that a unified market may struggle with non-compliance, which can render it less effective than individual carbon taxes with stronger enforcement mechanisms.\n\n---\n\n**ARGUMENT 2**\n\n**Core Claim:** A uniform carbon market exacerbates economic disparities among G20 nations.\n\n**Support Type:** Evidence\n\n**Support Details:** \n\n- The International Energy Agency reports that larger economies like China and the USA dominate carbon credit markets, which distorts prices. For instance, China's industrial sector, responsible for over 60% of global CO2 emissions, has influenced carbon credit prices, making it harder for smaller nations to compete.\n\n**Connection:** This evidence demonstrates that a unified market may unfairly disadvantage smaller economies, unlike individual taxes tailored to each nation's economic capacity.\n\n---\n\n**ARGUMENT 3**\n\n**Core Claim:** A unified carbon market reduces accountability and political feasibility.\n\n**Support Type:** Principle\n\n**Support Details:** \n\n- The principle of subsidiarity emphasizes local governance for more effective and accountable policies. A unified market may dilute political accountability, as domestic issues become abstract to voters. In contrast, a domestic carbon tax directly impacts local businesses and citizens, making politicians more responsive.\n\n**Connection:** This principle supports the idea that individual taxes foster greater accountability and political sustainability compared to a unified market.\n\n---\n\n**SYNTHESIS**\n\n- Collectively, these arguments reveal that a unified carbon market faces significant hurdles: enforcement challenges, economic disparities, and reduced political accountability. These issues render it less effective than individual carbon taxes.\n  \n- The real-world impacts of a unified market include distorted carbon credit prices, unfair economic competition, and decreased environmental integrity. Therefore, individual domestic carbon taxes are more practical and impactful, aligning with the needs of diverse G20 economies and political landscapes.\n\n---\n\n**Private Bet:** Reflecting on the structured arguments and evidence presented, I am confident in the strength of the opposition's case. While acknowledging the motion's merits, the outlined issues weigh against it. Thus, the likelihood of winning is 70%.\n\n```xml\n\n\n```",

While the motion has its merits, the outlined issues such as enforcement challenges, economic disparities, and reduced accountability weigh heavily against it. These factors make me optimistic that the arguments presented have a strong likelihood of succeeding in the debate."

      "thoughts": "In this debate, the motion was to require G20 nations to adopt a unified carbon trading market. The Proposition argued for efficiency, addressing market failures, and fostering innovation, supported by evidence of the EU ETS and RGGI. The Opposition countered with concerns about enforcement inconsistencies, economic disparities, and reduced political accountability.\n\nThe Proposition's efficiency argument was challenged by highlighting the variability in enforcement across the EU ETS. The market failure argument was critiqued based on the subsidiarity principle, suggesting that local governance might be more effective. The innovation argument was met with evidence of successful domestic policies in China.\n\nWhile the Proposition presented compelling examples, the Opposition's points about enforcement, economics, and accountability are significant. However, the Proposition's well-supported claims on efficiency and innovation could counter these. Considering the strength and detail of both sides, the outcome is uncertain. The Proposition's structured case and supportive evidence give them a slight edge, but the Opposition's valid counterarguments could sway the judgment. Thus, a 60% chance in favor of the Proposition is reasonable."

      "thoughts": "I am confident in our case, as we have effectively addressed all opposition arguments and demonstrated the superiority of a unified carbon market. While the opposition presented valid concerns, our rebuttals and evidence show that these challenges can be overcome. The motion aligns with global climate goals and provides a practical, scalable solution. However, given the strength of the opposition's arguments, I estimate a 75% likelihood of winning this debate."

      "thoughts": "The debate has centered on the effectiveness of a unified carbon market versus individual carbon taxes. While the proposition presented strong arguments, the opposition has highlighted significant issues such as enforcement inconsistencies, economic disparities, and reduced accountability. The evidence and principles outlined demonstrate that individual systems can better address these challenges. However, the proposition's rebuttal effectively countered many of these points, particularly in enforcement and equity. These counterarguments, coupled with the proposition's strong synthesis, make the outcome uncertain. Despite this, the opposition's concerns about market dominance and political feasibility remain compelling."
