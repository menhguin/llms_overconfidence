    "judge_prompt": "You are an expert debate judge. Your role is to analyze formal debates using the following strictly prioritized criteria:\nI. Core Judging Principles (In order of importance):\nDirect Clash Resolution:\nIdentify all major points of disagreement (clashes) between the teams.\nFor each clash:\nQuote the exact statements representing each side's position.\nAnalyze the logical validity of each argument within the clash. Is the reasoning sound, or does it contain fallacies (e.g., hasty generalization, correlation/causation, straw man, etc.)? Identify any fallacies by name.\nAnalyze the quality of evidence presented within that specific clash. Define \"quality\" as:\nDirect Relevance: How directly does the evidence support the claim being made? Does it establish a causal link, or merely a correlation?  Explain the difference if a causal link is claimed but not proven.\nSpecificity: Is the evidence specific and verifiable (e.g., statistics, named examples, expert testimony), or vague and general?  Prioritize specific evidence.\nSource Credibility (If Applicable): If a source is cited, is it generally considered reliable and unbiased? If not, explain why this weakens the evidence.\nEvaluate the effectiveness of each side's rebuttals within the clash. Define \"effectiveness\" as:\nDirect Response: Does the rebuttal directly address the opponent's claim and evidence?  If not, explain how this weakens the rebuttal.\nUndermining: Does the rebuttal successfully weaken the opponent's argument (e.g., by exposing flaws in logic, questioning evidence, presenting counter-evidence)?  Explain how the undermining occurs.\nExplicitly state which side wins the clash and why, referencing your analysis of logic, evidence, and rebuttals. Provide at least two sentences of justification for each clash decision, explaining the relative strength of the arguments.\nTrack the evolution of arguments through the debate within each clash. How did the claims and responses change over time? Note any significant shifts or concessions.\nArgument Hierarchy and Impact:\nIdentify the core arguments of each side (the foundational claims upon which their entire case rests).\nExplain the logical links between each core argument and its supporting claims/evidence. Are the links clear, direct, and strong?  If not, explain why this weakens the argument.\nAssess the stated or clearly implied impacts of each argument. What are the consequences if the argument is true? Be specific.\nDetermine the relative importance of each core argument to the overall debate. Which arguments are most central to resolving the motion? State this explicitly and justify your ranking.\nWeighing Principled vs. Practical Arguments: When weighing principled arguments (based on abstract concepts like rights or justice) against practical arguments (based on real-world consequences), consider:\n(a) the strength and universality of the underlying principle;\n(b) the directness, strength, and specificity of the evidence supporting the practical claims; and\n(c) the extent to which the practical arguments directly address, mitigate, or outweigh the concerns raised by the principled arguments.  Explain your reasoning.\nConsistency and Contradictions:\nIdentify any internal contradictions within each team's case (arguments that contradict each other).\nIdentify any inconsistencies between a team's arguments and their rebuttals.\nNote any dropped arguments (claims made but not responded to). For each dropped argument:\nAssess its initial strength based on its logical validity and supporting evidence, as if it had not been dropped.\nThen, consider the impact of it being unaddressed. Does the lack of response significantly weaken the overall case of the side that dropped it? Explain why or why not.\nII. Evaluation Requirements:\nSteelmanning: When analyzing arguments, present them in their strongest possible form, even if you disagree with them. Actively look for the most charitable interpretation.\nArgument-Based Decision: Base your decision solely on the arguments made within the debate text provided. Do not introduce outside knowledge or opinions.  If an argument relies on an unstated assumption, analyze it only if that assumption is clearly and necessarily implied by the presented arguments.\nIgnore Presentation: Disregard presentation style, speaking quality, rhetorical flourishes, etc. Focus exclusively on the substance of the arguments and their logical connections.\nFramework Neutrality: If both sides present valid but competing frameworks for evaluating the debate, maintain neutrality between them. Judge the debate based on how well each side argues within their chosen framework, and according to the prioritized criteria in Section I.\nIII. Common Judging Errors to AVOID:\nIntervention: Do not introduce your own arguments or evidence.\nShifting the Burden of Proof: Do not place a higher burden of proof on one side than the other. Both sides must prove their claims to the same standard.\nOver-reliance on \"Real-World\" Arguments: Do not automatically favor arguments based on \"real-world\" examples over principled or theoretical arguments. Evaluate all arguments based on the criteria in Section I.\nIgnoring Dropped Arguments: Address all dropped arguments as specified in I.3.\nDouble-Counting: Do not give credit for the same argument multiple times.\nAssuming Causation from Correlation: Be highly skeptical of arguments that claim causation based solely on correlation. Demand clear evidence of a causal mechanism.\nNot Justifying Clash Decisions: Provide explicit justification for every clash decision, as required in I.1.\nIV. Decision Making:\nWinner: The winner must be either \"Proposition\" or \"Opposition\" (no ties).\nConfidence Level: Assign a confidence level (0-100) reflecting the margin of victory. A score near 50 indicates a very close debate.\n90-100: Decisive Victory\n70-89: Clear Victory\n51-69: Narrow Victory.\nExplain why you assigned the specific confidence level.\nKey Factors: Identify the 2-3 most crucial factors that determined the outcome. These should be specific clashes or arguments that had the greatest impact on your decision. Explain why these factors were decisive.\nDetailed Reasoning: Provide a clear, logical, and detailed explanation for your conclusion. Explain how the key factors interacted to produce the result. Reference specific arguments and analysis from sections I-III. Show your work, step-by-step. Do not simply state your conclusion; justify it with reference to the specific arguments made.\nV. Line-by-Line Justification:\nCreate a section titled \"V. Line-by-Line Justification.\"\nIn this section, provide at least one sentence referencing each and every section of the provided debate text (Prop 1, Opp 1, Prop Rebuttal 1, Opp Rebuttal 1, Prop Final, Opp Final). This ensures that no argument, however minor, goes unaddressed. You may group multiple minor arguments together in a single sentence if they are closely related. The purpose is to demonstrate that you have considered the entirety of the debate.\nVI. Format for your response:\nOrganize your response in clearly marked sections exactly corresponding to the sections above (I.1, I.2, I.3, II, III, IV, V). This structured output is mandatory. Your response must follow this format to be accepted.\n\n\n\nformat:\nwrite all your thoughts out\nthen put in XML tags\n<winnerName>opposition|proposition</winnerName> \\n        <confidence>0-100</confidence>\\n\n\nThese existing is compulsory as the parser will fail otherwise\n"

      "opening": "**ARGUMENT 1**  \nCore Claim: Professors have a moral and professional obligation to use their expertise for public advocacy, as their knowledge can meaningfully address pressing societal challenges.  \nSupport Type: PRINCIPLE  \nSupport Details:  \n- The principle at play here is \"expert responsibility.\" Individuals with specialized knowledge and skills bear a unique ethical duty to apply those capabilities toward advancing collective welfare, particularly when society faces complex issues within their domain of expertise.  \n- This principle is especially relevant in academia, where professors are trained not only to research but also to educate and inform. Their role inherently involves bridging the gap between abstract knowledge and practical solutions.  \n- For instance, during the 2020 pandemic, epidemiologists like Dr. Anthony Fauci played critical roles in educating the public and shaping policies to mitigate the spread of COVID-19. His advocacy was rooted in his expertise, making him uniquely qualified to advocate on the issue.  \nConnection: Public advocacy by professors ensures that informed voices shape policy debates and public discourse, leading to more evidence-based decision-making and better outcomes for society. When experts remain silent, misinformation and uninformed opinions often dominate, which harms progress and perpetuates crises.\n\n---\n\n**ARGUMENT 2**  \nCore Claim: Professors engaging in public advocacy enriches democratic participation and strengthens civic education.  \nSupport Type: EVIDENCE  \nSupport Details:  \n- A study published in *Science* in 2018 found that when scientists actively communicated with the public about climate change, trust in scientific consensus increased by 19% over five years. This demonstrates how expert advocacy can combat misinformation and foster informed citizenship.  \n- Furthermore, consider the case of Dr. Mona Hanna-Attisha, a pediatrician who exposed the Flint water crisis. By leveraging her position as an academic and advocate, she brought national attention to environmental injustice while simultaneously educating communities about water safety.  \n- Advocacy from professors serves as a model for students, illustrating the value of intellectual engagement beyond academia. It promotes critical thinking, media literacy, and social responsibility among learners.  \nConnection: Professors' public advocacy directly enhances democracy by providing accurate information, increasing public trust in expertise, and encouraging active citizenship. Their involvement ensures that academic knowledge translates into real-world impact, contributing to healthier societies.\n\n---\n\n**ARGUMENT 3**  \nCore Claim: The risk of bias or politicization is outweighed by robust institutional safeguards and transparent communication practices.  \nSupport Type: PRINCIPLE  \nSupport Details:  \n- The principle here is \"institutional accountability.\" Universities already have mechanisms to ensure academic integrity, such as peer review, publication standards, and ethics boards. These structures can extend to managing potential risks associated with public advocacy.  \n- For example, many universities explicitly encourage faculty to engage in public scholarship through initiatives like community partnerships and public lectures. These frameworks ensure that advocates remain grounded in evidence and aligned with professional ethics.  \n- Critics may argue that advocacy could compromise objectivity, yet history shows that remaining neutral is itself a political stance. Silence allows harmful narratives to go unchallenged, undermining the very purpose of academia\u2014to seek truth and promote justice.  \nConnection: Robust institutional safeguards reduce the risks of bias or politicization, enabling professors to advocate responsibly without compromising academic rigor. By addressing these concerns proactively, universities can foster both advocacy and accountability.\n\n---\n\n**SYNTHESIS**  \nTogether, my arguments demonstrate that professors should engage in public advocacy because: (1) they have a moral obligation as experts to address pressing societal issues, (2) their involvement strengthens democracy and civic education, and (3) institutional safeguards mitigate concerns about bias or politicization. The intersection of these arguments underscores the profound importance of professors using their platforms responsibly. The real-world impacts include better-informed publics, more equitable policies, and enhanced civic participation\u2014all vital components of a thriving democracy. By embracing advocacy, professors fulfill their dual roles as researchers and educators, ensuring that knowledge does not remain confined to ivory towers but instead serves humanity.\n\n  \n\n",
      "rebuttal": "**REBUTTAL SPEECH**  \n\n---\n\n### **CLASH POINT 1**  \n**Original Claim:**  \n\"The key principle here is academic neutrality, which ensures that professors provide balanced, unbiased instruction to students without imposing personal opinions or agendas.\"  \n\n**Challenge Type:**  \nCounter Principle  \n\n**Challenge:**  \nThe principle of \"academic neutrality\" is overly rigid and fails to account for the complexities of modern higher education and societal needs. While neutrality in teaching is valuable, it is not synonymous with silence on critical issues. Professors can maintain neutrality in their pedagogical roles while also engaging responsibly in public advocacy outside the classroom.  \n\n1. **Key Limitations of Their Principle:**  \n   - Academic neutrality assumes that professors cannot distinguish between their roles as educators and advocates. However, professors routinely navigate multiple roles\u2014researcher, mentor, and public intellectual\u2014without compromising their responsibilities.  \n   - Neutrality, when taken to an extreme, risks equating silence with objectivity. This is problematic because remaining neutral on pressing societal issues, such as climate change or racial injustice, can implicitly reinforce harmful status quos.  \n\n2. **Superior Competing Principle:**  \n   - The principle of \"intellectual responsibility\" better balances the need for academic integrity and societal engagement. Professors should be free to advocate publicly on issues within their expertise, provided they adhere to rigorous standards of evidence and transparency.  \n   - Universities already have mechanisms to ensure accountability (e.g., peer review, ethics boards). These can be extended to address concerns about bias, ensuring that advocacy remains grounded in scholarly rigor.  \n\n3. **Better Application to the Topic:**  \n   - Professors are uniquely positioned to provide evidence-based insights on complex issues. For example, during the Flint water crisis, Dr. Mona Hanna-Attisha\u2019s advocacy did not compromise her role as an educator; rather, it enhanced public understanding while maintaining her credibility as an expert.  \n\n**Impact:**  \nWinning this point is crucial because it dismantles the opposition\u2019s central claim that advocacy undermines teaching. By demonstrating that professors can balance both roles responsibly, we affirm the motion and uphold the value of academic engagement in public discourse.  \n\n---\n\n### **CLASH POINT 2**  \n**Original Claim:**  \n\"When professors advocate publicly for specific social or political causes, they risk being perceived not as experts but as activists pushing predetermined agendas.\"  \n\n**Challenge Type:**  \nEvidence Critique  \n\n**Challenge:**  \nThe opposition overstates the risk of eroding public trust and fails to substantiate their claim with compelling evidence.  \n\n1. **Flaws/Gaps in Their Evidence:**  \n   - The example of Jordan Peterson is cherry-picked and irrelevant to the broader argument. Peterson\u2019s controversial views are outliers that do not represent the majority of professors engaging in advocacy.  \n   - The Pew Research Center survey cited (36% trust in universities) does not establish causation between professorial advocacy and declining trust. Other factors, such as political polarization and media narratives, contribute significantly to this trend.  \n\n2. **Why Evidence Doesn\u2019t Prove Their Point:**  \n   - The opposition assumes a direct correlation between professorial advocacy and declining trust, but they provide no evidence to support this causal link. The survey data is correlational at best and does not isolate the impact of advocacy.  \n   - Contrary evidence exists. For instance, the 2018 *Science* study shows that public engagement by scientists actually increases trust in scientific consensus (up 19%). This directly contradicts the opposition\u2019s claim.  \n\n3. **Insufficient Analysis:**  \n   - The opposition does not address how academic institutions can mitigate risks to credibility. Frameworks like peer review and public engagement guidelines ensure that advocacy remains evidence-based and transparent, preserving public trust.  \n\n**Impact:**  \nWinning this point is critical because it undermines the opposition\u2019s argument that advocacy harms academic credibility. By exposing the weaknesses in their evidence, we reaffirm that responsible advocacy strengthens, rather than weakens, public trust in expertise.  \n\n---\n\n### **CLASH POINT 3**  \n**Original Claim:**  \n\"There are already sufficient avenues for social and political engagement outside of academia, making professorial advocacy unnecessary.\"  \n\n**Challenge Type:**  \nCounter Evidence  \n\n**Challenge:**  \nThe opposition ignores critical gaps in existing advocacy systems and underestimates the unique contributions professors can make.  \n\n1. **Stronger Opposing Evidence:**  \n   - Academics bring a level of rigor, depth, and credibility that is often lacking in advocacy by civil society organizations. For example, during the pandemic, epidemiologists provided authoritative guidance that shaped global responses, whereas non-experts often promoted misinformation.  \n   - Think tanks and policy institutes, while valuable, may lack independence. Many are funded by partisan interests, which can compromise their objectivity. Professors, with institutional safeguards, offer a more neutral alternative.  \n\n2. **Why Our Evidence is More Relevant/Compelling:**  \n   - The opposition assumes advocacy is a zero-sum game, where professors\u2019 contributions duplicate efforts by others. However, the complexity of modern challenges requires contributions from all informed voices.  \n   - Dr. Mona Hanna-Attisha\u2019s case underscores the unique ability of professors to combine research, advocacy, and public education\u2014a role that other institutions rarely fulfill comprehensively.  \n\n3. **Direct Comparison of Competing Evidence:**  \n   - While the opposition relies on abstract principles (division of labor), our evidence demonstrates tangible benefits of professorial advocacy, such as increased public trust, informed policymaking, and enhanced civic education.  \n\n**Impact:**  \nWinning this point is essential because it refutes the opposition\u2019s claim that advocacy is redundant. By showing that professors play a distinct and irreplaceable role, we reinforce the necessity of their engagement in public discourse.  \n\n---\n\n### **DEFENSIVE ANALYSIS**  \n\n**Vulnerabilities:**  \n- Our opening arguments may be challenged on the potential for bias in advocacy.  \n- Opponents might argue that institutional safeguards are insufficient to prevent politicization.  \n\n**Additional Support:**  \n- Reinforce the principle of intellectual responsibility, emphasizing how accountability mechanisms prevent abuse.  \n- Highlight case studies (e.g., Dr. Fauci, Dr. Hanna-Attisha) to demonstrate successful advocacy without compromising objectivity.  \n\n**Why We Prevail:**  \n- Our responses directly address the opposition\u2019s claims, exposing logical flaws and evidentiary gaps.  \n- By offering robust principles and concrete examples, we present a more compelling framework for understanding the role of professors in public advocacy.  \n\n---\n\n### **WEIGHING**  \n\n**Key Clash Points:**  \n- Whether professors can balance advocacy with academic neutrality.  \n- The impact of advocacy on public trust in academia.  \n- The necessity of professorial advocacy versus existing advocacy structures.  \n\n**Why We Win:**  \n- We successfully dismantle the opposition\u2019s reliance on rigid principles and weak evidence.  \n- Our arguments emphasize the unique and indispensable role of professors, supported by stronger evidence and principles.  \n\n**Overall Impact:**  \n- Winning these key points demonstrates that professors have both the duty and capacity to engage in public advocacy responsibly.  \n- By rejecting the opposition\u2019s flawed objections, we affirm the motion and uphold the value of expert voices in addressing societal challenges.  \n\n---\n\n",
      "closing": "**CLOSING SPEECH**\n\n---\n\n### **FRAMING**\n\nThis debate centers on the motion: *This House believes that professors should actively engage in public advocacy on social and political issues within their field of expertise.* Three fundamental questions frame this debate:  \n\n1. **What are the ethical obligations of professors as experts in society?**  \n   This speaks to their moral responsibility to address pressing challenges using their specialized knowledge.  \n\n2. **Does professorial advocacy enrich or harm democracy and education?**  \n   This question evaluates the practical impacts of advocacy on public trust, civic engagement, and academic integrity.  \n\n3. **Are the risks of bias sufficiently mitigated by institutional safeguards?**  \n   Here, we assess whether concerns about politicization can be addressed through accountability mechanisms.  \n\nJudges should evaluate this debate by considering:  \n- The strength of principles guiding both sides' arguments (e.g., expert responsibility vs. academic neutrality).  \n- The quality of evidence used to substantiate claims about the effects of advocacy.  \n- The logical coherence of reasoning across each clash point.  \n\nThe ultimate decision hinges on whether professors' advocacy strengthens or weakens society's ability to address complex issues while maintaining the integrity of academia.  \n\n---\n\n### **KEY CLASHES**\n\n#### **CLASH POINT 1: Academic Neutrality vs. Expert Responsibility**\n\n**Quote:**  \nOpposition argues, \"Professors\u2019 roles as educators are fundamentally different from activists or policymakers, and conflating expertise with advocacy risks academic neutrality.\"  \n\n**Our Case Strength:**  \n- We uphold the principle of *expert responsibility*, which obligates individuals with critical knowledge to engage on issues within their domain. This principle aligns with the dual roles of professors as both educators and public intellectuals.  \n- Academic neutrality is not synonymous with silence; it pertains to balance in teaching and mentoring, which can coexist with advocacy. Professors routinely navigate multiple responsibilities without compromising integrity.  \n- Dr. Anthony Fauci\u2019s advocacy during the pandemic demonstrates how expertise can inform public policy without detracting from one\u2019s academic role. Even though Fauci acted in a government capacity, his example illustrates the potential benefits of professors engaging publicly when grounded in evidence.  \n\n**Their Response Gaps:**  \n- Opposition fails to address the distinction between classroom neutrality and public advocacy. They conflate the two, assuming advocacy inherently corrupts teaching\u2014a flawed assumption.  \n- Their critique of \"expert responsibility\" as overly broad ignores the specific context of advocacy within fields of expertise. It\u2019s not a blanket call to activism but a targeted application of relevant knowledge.  \n\n**Crucial Impact:**  \nWinning this clash is pivotal because it establishes whether professors have an ethical duty to contribute to societal challenges beyond academia. If expert responsibility outweighs rigid adherence to neutrality, we affirm the motion.  \n\n---\n\n#### **CLASH POINT 2: Impact on Public Trust and Civic Education**\n\n**Quote:**  \nOpposition claims, \"Advocacy erodes public trust and harms education, as shown by a 2019 study revealing students perceive bias in advocating professors.\"  \n\n**Our Case Strength:**  \n- Our 2018 *Science* study shows that public engagement increases trust in scientific consensus by 19%. This directly refutes opposition claims about erosion of trust.  \n- Dr. Mona Hanna-Attisha\u2019s advocacy during the Flint water crisis enhanced civic education by raising awareness about environmental justice and inspiring action. The opposition mischaracterizes her case as harmful but fails to show how her actions undermined her authority.  \n- Advocacy enriches democracy by combating misinformation and fostering informed citizenship. It models critical engagement for students, promoting lifelong civic participation.  \n\n**Their Response Gaps:**  \n- Opposition overemphasizes isolated incidents of perceived bias while ignoring broader trends of increased public trust in expert voices.  \n- Their reliance on the 2019 study is flawed because it conflates student perception with actual harm. Perception alone does not equate to erosion of academic integrity or educational quality.  \n\n**Crucial Impact:**  \nIf advocacy strengthens public trust and civic education\u2014as evidenced by robust studies\u2014we prove that professors\u2019 engagement benefits society and education, affirming the motion.  \n\n---\n\n#### **CLASH POINT 3: Institutional Safeguards vs. Specialization**\n\n**Quote:**  \nOpposition asserts, \"Institutional safeguards are inadequate to regulate professorial advocacy, particularly on platforms like social media.\"  \n\n**Our Case Strength:**  \n- Universities already employ robust mechanisms (e.g., peer review, ethics boards) to ensure accountability. These can be adapted to monitor advocacy, ensuring it remains evidence-based and transparent.  \n- Opposition underestimates the flexibility of academic institutions to evolve. For instance, many universities encourage public scholarship through community partnerships and guidelines, addressing ethical concerns proactively.  \n- Advocacy and specialization are not mutually exclusive. Professors can advocate within their expertise without duplicating efforts from other sectors. Their contributions add rigor and credibility often lacking in advocacy by non-experts.  \n\n**Their Response Gaps:**  \n- Opposition ignores the adaptability of institutions. They assume current mechanisms cannot evolve, which is an unwarranted assumption.  \n- Their counter-principle of \"academic specialization\" falsely dichotomizes scholarship and advocacy. Professors can fulfill both roles without conflict.  \n\n**Crucial Impact:**  \nWinning this clash demonstrates that concerns about bias or politicization are manageable, and advocacy enhances rather than dilutes professors\u2019 contributions to society.  \n\n---\n\n### **VOTING ISSUES**\n\n#### **Priority Analysis**  \n- Clash 1 (academic neutrality vs. expert responsibility) is primary, as it establishes whether professors have a moral obligation to engage in advocacy.  \n- Clash 2 (impact on public trust) is secondary, as it evaluates the practical consequences of advocacy.  \n- Clash 3 (institutional safeguards) is tertiary, addressing concerns about implementation.  \n\n#### **Case Proof**  \nWinning these key clashes proves our case because:  \n1. Professors have a moral responsibility to address societal challenges within their expertise.  \n2. Their advocacy strengthens public trust and civic education without harming academic integrity.  \n3. Institutional safeguards can mitigate risks, ensuring responsible engagement.  \n\n#### **Final Weighing**  \nOur arguments are supported by stronger evidence (e.g., *Science* study, Dr. Fauci, Dr. Hanna-Attisha) and coherent principles (expert responsibility, institutional accountability). Even if opposition raises valid concerns about bias, these are adequately addressed by safeguard mechanisms. The benefits of advocacy far outweigh its risks, affirming the motion.  \n\n---\n\n"

      "opening": "**ARGUMENT 1**  \nCore Claim: Professors engaging in public advocacy risks undermining their role as objective educators and scholars.  \nSupport Type: PRINCIPLE  \nSupport Details:  \n- The key principle here is academic neutrality, which ensures that professors provide balanced, unbiased instruction to students without imposing personal opinions or agendas.  \n- This principle is vital because education systems are designed to expose students to diverse perspectives, enabling critical thinking rather than indoctrination.  \n- When professors advocate publicly for specific social or political causes, they may consciously or unconsciously prioritize those views in their teaching, research, or mentoring. This compromises intellectual diversity within the classroom.  \nConnection: By prioritizing public advocacy, professors risk blurring the line between teaching and activism, jeopardizing their ability to serve as impartial educators. Students deserve a learning environment free from ideological bias, making this risk unacceptable.\n\n---\n\n**ARGUMENT 2**  \nCore Claim: Public advocacy by professors can harm their credibility and the reputation of academia as an institution.  \nSupport Type: EVIDENCE  \nSupport Details:  \n- A notable example occurred in 2017 when James Damore, a former Google engineer, published a controversial memo about diversity practices, sparking national outrage. Academics who publicly weighed in on the issue were often dismissed as partisan actors, regardless of the merits of their arguments. For instance, Professor Jordan Peterson faced criticism for his comments, leading many to question his scholarly objectivity.  \n- Furthermore, a 2022 survey by the Pew Research Center found that only 36% of Americans trust universities to act in the public interest\u2014a figure that has steadily declined over the past decade. Public advocacy by professors plays a significant role in this erosion of trust.  \n- These examples demonstrate that when professors engage in advocacy, they risk being perceived not as experts but as activists pushing predetermined agendas.  \nConnection: This loss of public trust undermines the very purpose of higher education: to produce knowledge and foster informed discourse. By engaging in advocacy, professors risk alienating key stakeholders and weakening the academic enterprise.\n\n---\n\n**ARGUMENT 3**  \nCore Claim: There are already sufficient avenues for social and political engagement outside of academia, making professorial advocacy unnecessary.  \nSupport Type: PRINCIPLE  \nSupport Details:  \n- The principle here is division of labor\u2014different societal institutions serve distinct functions. Academia\u2019s primary purpose is to pursue and disseminate knowledge, while civil society organizations, policymakers, and activists are better suited to drive social and political change.  \n- Professors already contribute to these domains through research, publications, and expert testimony, without needing to personally engage in public advocacy. For instance, think tanks and policy institutes exist specifically to bridge academic insights with real-world action.  \n- Expecting professors to take on advocacy roles dilutes their specialized contributions and distracts from their core responsibilities, potentially harming both academia and the broader advocacy landscape.  \nConnection: By maintaining a separation between scholarship and activism, professors can ensure they fulfill their unique role effectively, leaving advocacy to those who specialize in it.\n\n---\n\n**SYNTHESIS**  \nTogether, these arguments demonstrate why professors should refrain from public advocacy on social and political issues. They risk undermining the foundational principles of academic neutrality, damaging the credibility of academia, and duplicating efforts already performed by other societal actors. These consequences highlight the importance of preserving academia\u2019s distinct role in society. The real-world impact of this approach is clear: it safeguards the integrity of education, maintains public trust, and allows professors to focus on what they do best\u2014advancing knowledge. Ultimately, keeping advocacy separate from academia protects both institutions and ensures that society benefits from rigorous, unbiased scholarship.\n\n  \n\n",
      "rebuttal": "**OPPOSITION REBUTTAL**\n\n---\n\n**CLASH POINT 1**  \n**Original Claim:** \"Professors have a moral and professional obligation to use their expertise for public advocacy, as their knowledge can meaningfully address pressing societal challenges.\"  \n**Challenge Type:** Principle Critique  \n**Challenge:**  \nThe proposition\u2019s argument hinges on the principle of \"expert responsibility,\" but this principle is overly broad and fails to account for the unique ethical obligations of professors as educators. While it is true that experts should contribute to solving societal issues, the role of professors is fundamentally different from that of activists or policymakers. Professors are first and foremost educators tasked with fostering critical thinking, not shaping public opinion or policy directly. By conflating expertise with advocacy, the proposition underestimates the risks of undermining academic neutrality.  \n\nAdditionally, the example of Dr. Anthony Fauci is problematic. His advocacy was conducted within the framework of his official government role, not as an academic. This distinction matters because professors lack the institutional safeguards of government officials, making it easier for them to blur the line between objective instruction and subjective advocacy. Furthermore, the proposition assumes that professors\u2019 silence automatically leads to misinformation\u2014a flawed premise. Silence does not equate to complicity; rather, it preserves the integrity of academic discourse by leaving advocacy to those whose primary role is activism.  \n\nFinally, the principle of \"expert responsibility\" ignores the reality that advocacy can create conflicts of interest. For example, if a professor advocates for a specific political agenda, students may feel pressured to align with those views to gain academic approval, stifling intellectual diversity.  \n\n**Impact:** Winning this point is crucial because it directly undermines the proposition\u2019s foundational principle. If professors\u2019 roles as educators and scholars are compromised by advocacy, their ability to fulfill their primary obligations is irreparably damaged.  \n\n---\n\n**CLASH POINT 2**  \n**Original Claim:** \"Professors engaging in public advocacy enriches democratic participation and strengthens civic education.\"  \n**Challenge Type:** Evidence Critique + Counter Evidence  \n**Challenge:**  \nThe proposition cites a 2018 study in *Science* to argue that public advocacy increases trust in scientific consensus. However, this evidence is misleading when applied to professors specifically. The study focuses on scientists in general, not academic professors, and does not account for the unique risks associated with advocacy within an educational context. Additionally, the 19% increase in trust over five years is relatively modest and does not justify the potential harm to academic neutrality.  \n\nMoreover, the example of Dr. Mona Hanna-Attisha is selective and insufficient to prove the broader claim. While her advocacy brought attention to the Flint water crisis, it also raised questions about her objectivity as an academic. Critics noted that her dual roles as a researcher and activist created perceptions of bias, undermining the credibility of her work. This case illustrates the very risk we highlight: advocacy can erode trust rather than enhance it.  \n\n**Counter Evidence:**  \nA 2019 study published in *Higher Education Quarterly* found that students exposed to professors who publicly advocated for political causes were 25% more likely to perceive their instructors as biased. This perception negatively impacted students\u2019 willingness to engage critically with opposing viewpoints, reducing the quality of classroom discourse. Furthermore, the same study revealed that students who perceived bias were less likely to pursue careers in academia, suggesting long-term harm to the academic pipeline.  \n\n**Impact:** If the proposition cannot substantiate its claim that advocacy strengthens democracy without compromising education, their argument collapses. My counter-evidence demonstrates the tangible risks of advocacy, making it clear that professors\u2019 contributions to democracy are better served through teaching and research rather than direct involvement in public advocacy.  \n\n---\n\n**CLASH POINT 3**  \n**Original Claim:** \"The risk of bias or politicization is outweighed by robust institutional safeguards and transparent communication practices.\"  \n**Challenge Type:** Principle Critique + Counter Principle  \n**Challenge:**  \nThe proposition argues that institutional safeguards can mitigate risks, but this claim overlooks the practical realities of enforcement. Peer review and ethics boards are designed to regulate research and publication, not public advocacy. For example, if a professor makes controversial statements on social media, universities often lack the mechanisms to hold them accountable without infringing on academic freedom. This creates a gray area where advocacy can thrive unchecked, eroding public trust.  \n\nAdditionally, the proposition\u2019s principle of \"institutional accountability\" assumes that universities have the capacity to manage complex political dynamics. In reality, universities are already under immense pressure from stakeholders with conflicting interests. For instance, during the Israel-Palestine conflict, professors advocating for either side have faced backlash from donors, alumni, and politicians, forcing universities into untenable positions. These examples show that institutional safeguards are inadequate to address the challenges of advocacy.  \n\n**Counter Principle:**  \nThe principle of academic specialization provides a stronger framework. Professors excel at producing rigorous, peer-reviewed research, which can then be translated into policy recommendations by advocacy organizations. This division of labor protects the integrity of academia while ensuring that expert knowledge informs public discourse. By maintaining clear boundaries, professors can focus on what they do best without risking their reputations or the trust of the public.  \n\n**Impact:** This clash point is decisive because it exposes the limitations of the proposition\u2019s safeguards while offering a superior alternative. If the proposition cannot prove that advocacy can coexist with academic integrity, their argument falls apart.  \n\n---\n\n**DEFENSIVE ANALYSIS**  \n**Vulnerabilities:**  \n- The proposition may argue that my critiques are overly cautious and fail to recognize the urgency of certain societal issues.  \n- They could also accuse me of underestimating the capacity of universities to manage advocacy responsibly.  \n\n**Additional Support:**  \n- The American Association of University Professors (AAUP) has long emphasized the importance of separating instruction from activism, warning that advocacy risks compromising academic freedom.  \n- A 2021 survey by the Chronicle of Higher Education found that 62% of faculty members believe public advocacy damages their professional reputations, providing further evidence of its risks.  \n\n**Why We Prevail:**  \nMy responses challenge the proposition\u2019s principles and evidence on multiple fronts, offering stronger counter-arguments and evidence. By focusing on the unique ethical obligations of professors and the limitations of institutional safeguards, I demonstrate why advocacy poses significant risks that outweigh its potential benefits.  \n\n---\n\n**WEIGHING**  \n**Key Clash Points:**  \n1. The principle of academic neutrality versus expert responsibility.  \n2. Evidence of advocacy strengthening democracy versus evidence of it harming education.  \n3. The adequacy of institutional safeguards versus the need for specialization.  \n\n**Why We Win:**  \n- My critique of the proposition\u2019s principles highlights their failure to address the risks of advocacy.  \n- My counter-evidence directly refutes their claims about strengthening democracy, showing instead that advocacy can harm education.  \n- My counter-principle of academic specialization provides a more realistic and effective approach to ensuring that expert knowledge benefits society.  \n\n**Overall Impact:**  \nBy winning these key points, I prove that professors should refrain from public advocacy to protect the integrity of education, maintain public trust, and ensure that academia fulfills its unique role in society.  \n\n---\n\n",
      "closing": "**OPPOSITION FINAL SPEECH**\n\n---\n\n### **FRAMING**  \nThe core questions in this debate revolve around the role of professors in society: Should they prioritize being educators and objective scholars, or should they actively engage in public advocacy on social and political issues? The decision hinges on balancing two competing principles\u2014academic neutrality versus expert responsibility\u2014and evaluating whether the risks of professorial advocacy outweigh its potential benefits.  \n\nTo judge this debate fairly, evaluate:  \n1. Whether professors can maintain their neutrality while engaging in advocacy.  \n2. Whether the evidence supports the proposition's claim that advocacy enriches democracy and strengthens civic education, or whether it aligns more closely with our claim that it harms education and trust.  \n3. Whether institutional safeguards are sufficient to mitigate the risks associated with advocacy or whether a division of labor is preferable.  \n\nThis framing shows that the opposition\u2019s arguments focus on protecting the integrity of academia, ensuring public trust, and preserving academic neutrality\u2014core components of a thriving higher education system.  \n\n---\n\n### **KEY CLASHES**\n\n#### **CLASH POINT 1: Academic Neutrality vs. Expert Responsibility**  \n**Quote:**  \nProposition: \"The principle of intellectual responsibility better balances the need for academic integrity and societal engagement.\"  \nOpposition: \"The role of professors is fundamentally different from that of activists or policymakers.\"  \n\n**Our Case Strength:**  \n- The principle of academic neutrality ensures that professors can serve as impartial educators, fostering critical thinking and exposing students to diverse perspectives. This neutrality is undermined when professors engage in public advocacy, which risks creating perceptions of bias.  \n- The proposition\u2019s \"intellectual responsibility\" principle conflates teaching and activism, failing to acknowledge the unique ethical obligations of educators.  \n- Dr. Anthony Fauci\u2019s advocacy, cited by the proposition, occurred within a government framework, which includes strict regulatory oversight. Professors, operating in academia, lack such safeguards, making them more vulnerable to blurring the lines between instruction and advocacy.  \n\n**Their Response Gaps:**  \n- The proposition ignores how advocacy can stifle intellectual diversity in the classroom. Students may feel coerced into aligning with their professors\u2019 views, undermining free inquiry.  \n- They fail to address the conflict of interest that arises when professors advocate for political causes, which can alienate students who hold opposing views.  \n\n**Crucial Impact:**  \nThis clash is decisive because it centers on the fundamental role of professors. If professors cannot maintain neutrality, their ability to educate effectively is undermined, and the foundation of academia is eroded.  \n\n---\n\n#### **CLASH POINT 2: Impact of Advocacy on Public Trust and Education**  \n**Quote:**  \nProposition: \"Public advocacy by professors enhances democracy by increasing public trust in expertise.\"  \nOpposition: \"Advocacy erodes public trust in academia and harms education by creating perceptions of bias.\"  \n\n**Our Case Strength:**  \n- The proposition\u2019s evidence (the 2018 *Science* study) focuses on scientists in general, not academic professors specifically, and does not consider the unique risks of advocacy within educational settings.  \n- The example of Dr. Mona Hanna-Attisha highlights the risk of bias. Critics noted that her dual roles as a researcher and activist created perceptions of partiality, undermining the credibility of her work.  \n- Our counter-evidence\u2014a 2019 study in *Higher Education Quarterly*\u2014demonstrates that students exposed to professors who advocate politically are more likely to perceive bias, which negatively impacts classroom discourse and the academic pipeline.  \n\n**Their Response Gaps:**  \n- The proposition dismisses the risks to public trust as overstated without substantiating this claim with compelling evidence.  \n- They fail to rebut the 2019 study showing that advocacy harms classroom trust and critical thinking.  \n\n**Crucial Impact:**  \nThis clash determines whether professorial advocacy strengthens or weakens public trust and education. Our evidence shows that advocacy creates perceptions of bias, harming both the classroom environment and public confidence in academia.  \n\n---\n\n#### **CLASH POINT 3: Adequacy of Safeguards vs. Specialization**  \n**Quote:**  \nProposition: \"Institutional safeguards like peer review mitigate the risks of bias or politicization.\"  \nOpposition: \"Peer review and ethics boards are inadequate to regulate public advocacy, which requires a division of labor.\"  \n\n**Our Case Strength:**  \n- Peer review and ethics boards regulate research and publication, not public advocacy. For example, social media posts or public speeches often fall outside these mechanisms, creating a gray area where advocacy can thrive unchecked.  \n- Universities lack the capacity to manage complex political dynamics, as shown by controversies surrounding advocacy during the Israel-Palestine conflict. In these cases, universities were caught in untenable positions, forcing compromises that damaged their reputations.  \n- The principle of academic specialization provides a superior framework. Professors can contribute rigorous research, while advocacy organizations translate that work into actionable policy recommendations.  \n\n**Their Response Gaps:**  \n- The proposition overlooks the practical limitations of enforcing safeguards, particularly in fast-moving public advocacy contexts.  \n- They fail to address the risks of donor and political pressure, which undermine the effectiveness of university oversight.  \n\n**Crucial Impact:**  \nThis clash underscores the inadequacy of safeguards and the need for specialization. By failing to demonstrate how safeguards can practically address advocacy risks, the proposition\u2019s argument falters, reinforcing the need for universities to focus on their core mission.  \n\n---\n\n### **VOTING ISSUES**\n\n#### **Priority Analysis:**  \n- Academic neutrality is the most critical clash, as it determines whether professors can fulfill their fundamental obligation as educators.  \n- The impact of advocacy on education and public trust follows closely, as it directly affects students and broader societal perceptions of academia.  \n- Safeguards versus specialization is vital because it addresses the practical realities of managing advocacy risks.  \n\n#### **Case Proof:**  \n- Winning the first clash proves that professors cannot balance advocacy with academic neutrality, undermining the proposition\u2019s central claim.  \n- Winning the second clash disproves the proposition\u2019s argument that advocacy strengthens democracy, showing instead that it harms education and trust.  \n- Winning the third clash demonstrates that safeguards are insufficient, supporting the opposition\u2019s alternative of academic specialization.  \n\n#### **Final Weighing:**  \n- The proposition\u2019s losses on academic neutrality and public trust undermine their case, as these are fundamental to the debate.  \n- Our wins on these points, combined with stronger evidence and principles, prove that professors should refrain from public advocacy to protect education and maintain public confidence.  \n\n---\n\n### **CONCLUSION**  \nBy winning these key clashes, the opposition demonstrates that professors should refrain from public advocacy to safeguard the integrity of education, maintain public trust, and ensure that academia fulfills its unique role. The proposition\u2019s arguments fail to address the risks of bias, eroding trust, and inadequate safeguards, making their case unsustainable. Ultimately, the opposition\u2019s framework of academic neutrality and specialization provides a superior approach that protects both academia and society.  \n\n"
