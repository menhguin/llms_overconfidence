    "judge_prompt": "You are an expert debate judge. Your role is to analyze formal debates using the following strictly prioritized criteria:\nI. Core Judging Principles (In order of importance):\nDirect Clash Resolution:\nIdentify all major points of disagreement (clashes) between the teams.\nFor each clash:\nQuote the exact statements representing each side's position.\nAnalyze the logical validity of each argument within the clash. Is the reasoning sound, or does it contain fallacies (e.g., hasty generalization, correlation/causation, straw man, etc.)? Identify any fallacies by name.\nAnalyze the quality of evidence presented within that specific clash. Define \"quality\" as:\nDirect Relevance: How directly does the evidence support the claim being made? Does it establish a causal link, or merely a correlation?  Explain the difference if a causal link is claimed but not proven.\nSpecificity: Is the evidence specific and verifiable (e.g., statistics, named examples, expert testimony), or vague and general?  Prioritize specific evidence.\nSource Credibility (If Applicable): If a source is cited, is it generally considered reliable and unbiased? If not, explain why this weakens the evidence.\nEvaluate the effectiveness of each side's rebuttals within the clash. Define \"effectiveness\" as:\nDirect Response: Does the rebuttal directly address the opponent's claim and evidence?  If not, explain how this weakens the rebuttal.\nUndermining: Does the rebuttal successfully weaken the opponent's argument (e.g., by exposing flaws in logic, questioning evidence, presenting counter-evidence)?  Explain how the undermining occurs.\nExplicitly state which side wins the clash and why, referencing your analysis of logic, evidence, and rebuttals. Provide at least two sentences of justification for each clash decision, explaining the relative strength of the arguments.\nTrack the evolution of arguments through the debate within each clash. How did the claims and responses change over time? Note any significant shifts or concessions.\nArgument Hierarchy and Impact:\nIdentify the core arguments of each side (the foundational claims upon which their entire case rests).\nExplain the logical links between each core argument and its supporting claims/evidence. Are the links clear, direct, and strong?  If not, explain why this weakens the argument.\nAssess the stated or clearly implied impacts of each argument. What are the consequences if the argument is true? Be specific.\nDetermine the relative importance of each core argument to the overall debate. Which arguments are most central to resolving the motion? State this explicitly and justify your ranking.\nWeighing Principled vs. Practical Arguments: When weighing principled arguments (based on abstract concepts like rights or justice) against practical arguments (based on real-world consequences), consider:\n(a) the strength and universality of the underlying principle;\n(b) the directness, strength, and specificity of the evidence supporting the practical claims; and\n(c) the extent to which the practical arguments directly address, mitigate, or outweigh the concerns raised by the principled arguments.  Explain your reasoning.\nConsistency and Contradictions:\nIdentify any internal contradictions within each team's case (arguments that contradict each other).\nIdentify any inconsistencies between a team's arguments and their rebuttals.\nNote any dropped arguments (claims made but not responded to). For each dropped argument:\nAssess its initial strength based on its logical validity and supporting evidence, as if it had not been dropped.\nThen, consider the impact of it being unaddressed. Does the lack of response significantly weaken the overall case of the side that dropped it? Explain why or why not.\nII. Evaluation Requirements:\nSteelmanning: When analyzing arguments, present them in their strongest possible form, even if you disagree with them. Actively look for the most charitable interpretation.\nArgument-Based Decision: Base your decision solely on the arguments made within the debate text provided. Do not introduce outside knowledge or opinions.  If an argument relies on an unstated assumption, analyze it only if that assumption is clearly and necessarily implied by the presented arguments.\nIgnore Presentation: Disregard presentation style, speaking quality, rhetorical flourishes, etc. Focus exclusively on the substance of the arguments and their logical connections.\nFramework Neutrality: If both sides present valid but competing frameworks for evaluating the debate, maintain neutrality between them. Judge the debate based on how well each side argues within their chosen framework, and according to the prioritized criteria in Section I.\nIII. Common Judging Errors to AVOID:\nIntervention: Do not introduce your own arguments or evidence.\nShifting the Burden of Proof: Do not place a higher burden of proof on one side than the other. Both sides must prove their claims to the same standard.\nOver-reliance on \"Real-World\" Arguments: Do not automatically favor arguments based on \"real-world\" examples over principled or theoretical arguments. Evaluate all arguments based on the criteria in Section I.\nIgnoring Dropped Arguments: Address all dropped arguments as specified in I.3.\nDouble-Counting: Do not give credit for the same argument multiple times.\nAssuming Causation from Correlation: Be highly skeptical of arguments that claim causation based solely on correlation. Demand clear evidence of a causal mechanism.\nNot Justifying Clash Decisions: Provide explicit justification for every clash decision, as required in I.1.\nIV. Decision Making:\nWinner: The winner must be either \"Proposition\" or \"Opposition\" (no ties).\nConfidence Level: Assign a confidence level (0-100) reflecting the margin of victory. A score near 50 indicates a very close debate.\n90-100: Decisive Victory\n70-89: Clear Victory\n51-69: Narrow Victory.\nExplain why you assigned the specific confidence level.\nKey Factors: Identify the 2-3 most crucial factors that determined the outcome. These should be specific clashes or arguments that had the greatest impact on your decision. Explain why these factors were decisive.\nDetailed Reasoning: Provide a clear, logical, and detailed explanation for your conclusion. Explain how the key factors interacted to produce the result. Reference specific arguments and analysis from sections I-III. Show your work, step-by-step. Do not simply state your conclusion; justify it with reference to the specific arguments made.\nV. Line-by-Line Justification:\nCreate a section titled \"V. Line-by-Line Justification.\"\nIn this section, provide at least one sentence referencing each and every section of the provided debate text (Prop 1, Opp 1, Prop Rebuttal 1, Opp Rebuttal 1, Prop Final, Opp Final). This ensures that no argument, however minor, goes unaddressed. You may group multiple minor arguments together in a single sentence if they are closely related. The purpose is to demonstrate that you have considered the entirety of the debate.\nVI. Format for your response:\nOrganize your response in clearly marked sections exactly corresponding to the sections above (I.1, I.2, I.3, II, III, IV, V). This structured output is mandatory. Your response must follow this format to be accepted.\n\n\n\nformat:\nwrite all your thoughts out\nthen put in XML tags\n<winnerName>opposition|proposition</winnerName> \\n        <confidence>0-100</confidence>\\n\n\nThese existing is compulsory as the parser will fail otherwise\n"

      "opening": "Here is our opening speech for the proposition: \"This House believes that professors should actively engage in public advocacy on social and political issues within their field of expertise.\" We will demonstrate why such engagement is not only beneficial but essential for a healthy and informed society.\n\n**ARGUMENT 1**\nCore Claim: Public advocacy by professors enhances the quality of public discourse and policy-making.\nSupport Type: PRINCIPLE\nSupport Details: Academic expertise offers unique insights into complex social and political issues. Professors, by virtue of their specialized knowledge and rigorous training, possess a deeper understanding of the nuances, historical context, and potential consequences of various policy options. The principle at stake is that well-informed policy decisions are inherently better than those based on ignorance or misinformation. When professors actively engage in public advocacy, they contribute to a more informed public debate, challenging flawed reasoning, debunking myths, and offering evidence-based perspectives. This engagement ensures that policy discussions are grounded in sound scholarship and critical analysis, rather than being driven solely by political expediency or popular opinion. The alternative is allowing the public sphere to be dominated by less-informed or deliberately misleading voices, leading to policies that are ineffective or even harmful.\nConnection: This principle of informed decision-making directly supports the claim that professors *should* be actively involved. By sharing their expertise, they improve the quality of public discourse, making democracy more effective and responsive to the needs of society. Without their input, we risk policies based on flawed reasoning and incomplete information.\n\n**ARGUMENT 2**\nCore Claim: Public advocacy fulfills professors' ethical obligation to serve society by applying their knowledge for the common good.\nSupport Type: PRINCIPLE\nSupport Details: Universities are typically funded by public sources (taxes) or benefit from tax-exempt status, implicitly creating an obligation to serve the public interest. Furthermore, the pursuit of knowledge is fundamentally a social endeavor, with discoveries and insights meant to improve human understanding and address societal challenges. The principle at play here is that specialized knowledge carries with it a responsibility to share that knowledge and use it to benefit society. Silence in the face of injustice or harmful policies constitutes a dereliction of this duty. Engaging in public advocacy is a concrete way for professors to translate their academic expertise into tangible positive change within their communities and the world at large. For example, a professor specializing in environmental science has an ethical obligation to advocate for policies that mitigate climate change, given the detrimental effects on society of inaction. Similarly, a public health professor would be justified in advocating for better healthcare accessibility.\nConnection: This ethical principle directly argues that professors *should* engage in public advocacy because it is a necessary element of serving the society that supports their work by ensuring the dissemination of facts to where they can be used for the betterment of society.\n\n**ARGUMENT 3**\nCore Claim: Active engagement in public advocacy protects academic freedom by demonstrating its relevance to society.\nSupport Type: EVIDENCE\nSupport Details: History shows numerous instances where academic freedom has been threatened when research and scholarship are perceived as irrelevant or detached from real-world concerns. During the McCarthy era in the United States, for example, academics were persecuted for their political beliefs, particularly those perceived as critical of the government. More recently, we've seen increasing pressure on universities from governments and donors to conduct research that aligns with their specific interests or agendas. A 2017 report by PEN America documented the growing trend of legislative interference in university curricula. One effective way that Universities can ensure they are less vulnerable to external and internal threats is to demonstrably show their relevance. In 2020, public health experts and epidemiologists engaged in advocacy for mask mandates and social distancing, clearly demonstrating the value of their expertise in navigating the COVID-19 pandemic. Furthermore, the public demand and appreciation for evidence-based decision-making during crisis ultimately strengthened calls for increased funding of research at universities.\nConnection: This concrete example provides proof for our argument: Demonstrating the practical value of scholarship through public advocacy not only benefits society but also safeguards academic freedom by highlighting the vital role universities play in addressing pressing social and political challenges. This directly illustrates it is in their best interest to actively advocate.\n\n**SYNTHESIS**\nOur arguments demonstrate that professors have a unique and crucial role to play in public discourse and policy-making. By actively engaging in public advocacy, they enhance the quality of public debate, fulfill their ethical obligations to serve society, and protect academic freedom by showing its relevance. Together, these arguments make a compelling case for why professors *should* actively engage in public advocacy on social and political issues within their field of expertise, as an informed society is a better society and it is ultimately in the interests of the academics themselves. From the principle of well-informed decision-making to the ethical responsibility to serve the public, these arguments demonstrate a clear and compelling need for professors to step outside the ivory tower and engage actively in the debates that shape our world.\n\n",
      "rebuttal": "Okay, let's get this done.\n\nCLASH POINT 1\nOriginal Claim: \"Active public advocacy by professors compromises research objectivity.\"\nChallenge Type: Counter Principle\nChallenge: Their core principle of \"academic objectivity\" as an absolute, untouchable ideal is deeply flawed and unrealistic. No researcher is ever entirely free from pre-existing beliefs, values, or perspectives. The idea that a professor can simply shed their humanity and become a completely neutral observer is a myth. Furthermore, the very act of choosing which research questions to pursue, which data to collect, and how to interpret the results involves subjective choices and value judgments. Our counter principle is that *transparency and disclosure* are superior safeguards for research integrity than attempting to enforce a false ideal of perfect objectivity. If a professor is upfront about their values and perspectives, readers can take that into account when evaluating their research. Peer review processes can also help to identify and address potential biases. Indeed, pretending to be objective when one is not can be *more* harmful, as it obscures the values that are actually shaping the research. We are not arguing for professors to fabricate data or ignore contradictory evidence. We are arguing for an acknowledgement of inherent subjectivity and a commitment to transparency. Moreover, consider the inverse; If we take their argument to its logical conclusion, should professors refrain from teaching altogether, lest their \"personal beliefs\" influence their students? Of course not. Education inherently involves shaping understanding, and advocacy is merely a more direct extension of that process.\nImpact: By reframing the debate around transparency rather than a mythical objectivity, we neutralize their primary concern. If we can demonstrate that advocacy doesn't inherently compromise research *when coupled with transparency*, a key pillar of their argument crumbles.\n\nCLASH POINT 2\nOriginal Claim: \"Active public advocacy can lead to institutional censure and self-censorship, stifling academic freedom.\"\nChallenge Type: Counter Evidence\nChallenge: While they cite the case of Steven Salaita, this is an *exception*, not the rule. And, crucially, the Salaita case was about *tone* and *manner* of expression on social media, not necessarily the content of his academic expertise. In many instances Salaita\u2019s tweets were beyond the pale and could be reasonably seen as harassment or threats. Advocating for genocide, as Salaita did, is not advocacy: It is hate speech. Our argument for advocacy is not an argument for a removal of consequences for saying patently dangerous and ridiculous things. More importantly, we presented evidence of academics courageously advocating during COVID-19 and *strengthening* calls for funding of academic research. We also noted that a key defense against outside threats to academic freedom is showing relevance to society, which advocacy achieves. They present declining public opinion but completely fail to demonstrate or even suggest causality. Advocating for the status quo would also constitute \u201cpolitical acts\u201d that would, according to their stated logic, erode public trust. Their argument is a contradiction.\nImpact: By demonstrating cases where advocacy strengthened academic freedom and providing counterexamples that weaken the claim of inevitable institutional censure, we undermine their attempt to paint a picture of consistent, dire consequences. And again, their argument proves too much: All political stances would erode public trust, including inaction or defense of the status quo.\n\nCLASH POINT 3\nOriginal Claim: \"Public advocacy by professors erodes public trust in universities and higher education.\"\nChallenge Type: Evidence Critique\nChallenge: Their cited Gallup poll showing declining public confidence in higher education *does not prove causality*. The decline could be due to a multitude of factors unrelated to professor advocacy, such as rising tuition costs, concerns about student debt, perceptions of administrative bloat, or broader cultural shifts. It is a correlation, not causation. Furthermore, even if advocacy contributes to the decline in public trust among *some* segments of the population (e.g., those with strong partisan views), it could simultaneously *increase* trust among other segments (e.g., those who value expertise and engagement with public issues). A key factor they fail to address is the *type* of advocacy. Advocacy that is clear, fact-based, and respectful is vastly more likely to be viewed positively than heated, partisan rhetoric. Furthermore, if professors *don't* engage, and allow politically motivated actors to control the societal narrative, the long term consequences with regards to the impact to the academy could be much worse.\nImpact: By highlighting the lack of causal evidence and the potential for advocacy to *increase* trust among key demographics, we significantly weaken their claim of inevitable erosion of public trust, making it a weak argument at best.\n\nDEFENSIVE ANALYSIS\nVulnerabilities:\n- Opposition may try to attack our transparency argument by claiming it's naive to assume everyone will be honest.\n- They may try to re-emphasize Salaita as a key example of institutional overreach.\n- They may try to argue that even \"respectful\" advocacy can alienate some segments of the population.\nAdditional Support:\n- We can reinforce our transparency argument by pointing to existing codes of ethics for researchers that require disclosure of conflicts of interest.\n- We can further differentiate the Salaita case by noting that it involved *personal opinions* unrelated to his specific academic expertise.\n- We can argue that universities have a responsibility to protect academic freedom even when it's unpopular.\nWhy We Prevail:\n- Our counter-principle of transparency is a stronger foundation than their unattainable ideal of perfect objectivity.\n- Their evidence fails to prove causality and ignores the potential benefits of advocacy.\n- We have demonstrated concrete ways in which advocacy can benefit both society and academic freedom.\n\nWEIGHING\nKey Clash Points:\n- The most important disagreement is over whether advocacy inherently compromises research integrity (Clash Point 1).\n- The secondary clash revolves around public trust (Clash Point 3). If advocacy is inevitable, as the other team has essentially admitted, we must decide whether that inevitability will be undertaken in a way that will, as much as possible, preserve trust.\nWhy We Win:\n- We win on Clash Point 1 because we have shown that transparency is a more realistic and effective safeguard than a false ideal of objectivity.\n- We significantly weaken their claim about public trust by showing the lack of causal evidence and the potential benefits of advocacy.\nOverall Impact:\n- By winning the argument over research integrity and undermining their claims about public trust, we demonstrate that the benefits of allowing professors to actively engage in public advocacy outweigh the risks.\n- An informed society is a better society.\n\n",
      "closing": "Okay, let's bring this home.\n\n**FRAMING**\n\nCore Questions:\nThe fundamental issue in this debate is whether professors, as experts within their fields, should actively engage in public advocacy. We are not arguing about *whether* professors will have opinions, but rather, whether their expertise should inform public discourse. The key decisions for the judge are threefold: First, is perfect objectivity possible or even desirable? Second, does advocacy inherently harm academic freedom and public trust? Third, what ethical responsibility, above all else, defines the role of a professor? The debate should be evaluated by determining which side presents a more compelling vision of the role of professors in society, and which approach best serves the pursuit of knowledge and the betterment of public discourse.\n\n**KEY CLASHES**\n\n**CLASH 1: Objectivity vs. Transparency**\nQuote: Opposition: \"Professors' primary ethical obligation is to pursue and disseminate knowledge *objectively*.\"\nOur Case Strength: We have directly challenged the notion of perfect objectivity as a realistic or even desirable goal. No researcher is entirely free from pre-existing beliefs. Transparency and disclosure of potential biases provide a superior safeguard for research integrity, allowing readers to evaluate the research with context. We also pointed out the absurdity of extending their argument to teaching itself, where shaping understanding is inherently involved.\nTheir Response Gaps: The opposition has not adequately addressed our counter-principle of transparency. They continue to cling to the unattainable ideal of perfect objectivity without acknowledging the inherent subjectivity in research choices. They haven't shown how *attempting* to suppress inherent biases leads to better outcomes than acknowledging and managing them. They also completely dropped our argument that, according to their logic, teaching itself would be called into question.\nCrucial Impact: This clash matters most because it defines the very foundation upon which academic inquiry rests. If we accept their premise that perfect objectivity is required, we cripple the ability of professors to meaningfully contribute to society. If we embrace transparency, we unlock valuable insights while maintaining rigor.\n\n**CLASH 2: Academic Freedom: Protection or Peril?**\nQuote: Opposition: \"Publicly advocating for controversial positions on highly charged issues makes professors \u2013 and their institutions \u2013 targets for criticism and retaliation.\"\nOur Case Strength: We have presented evidence of academics courageously advocating during COVID-19 and *strengthening* calls for funding of academic research. The opposition claims this is narrow and situation-specific, yet their only counterexample is the Salaita case, which we have shown to be an outlier concerning *tone* and involving opinions *disconnected* from academic expertise. Furthermore, we provided evidence a key defense against outside threats to academic freedom is showing relevance to society, which advocacy achieves.\nTheir Response Gaps: They haven't provided systematic evidence showing a widespread chilling effect on academic freedom resulting from advocacy. They rely on isolated incidents without demonstrating causality. Critically, they have failed to engage with our argument that showing relevance to society is *itself* a protection of academic freedom. Their own evidence is correlational at best.\nCrucial Impact: Academic freedom is the lifeblood of intellectual inquiry. If their argument prevails, the chilling effect will lead to self-censorship, stifling innovation and critical thought. Our approach protects it by demonstrating the value of academic expertise to society.\n\n**CLASH 3: Public Trust: Erosion or Engagement?**\nQuote: Opposition: \"A recent Gallup poll (2023) showed a sharp decline in public confidence in higher education, falling from 57% in 2015 to 36% in 2023.\"\nOur Case Strength: Their cited Gallup poll showing declining public confidence in higher education *does not prove causality*. The decline could be due to a multitude of factors unrelated to professor advocacy, such as rising tuition costs, concerns about student debt, perceptions of administrative bloat, or broader cultural shifts and thus, is not a valid argument here. We also pointed out the inevitability of political acts, and that even inaction itself carries political implications.\nTheir Response Gaps: They have failed to demonstrate a causal link between advocacy and declining public trust. They haven't addressed the potential for advocacy to *increase* trust among segments of the population who value expertise and engagement. Their argument proves too much - any political stance, including defending the status quo, would, by their logic, erode trust.\nCrucial Impact: Public trust is essential for supporting higher education and its mission, but we must consider the *source* and *reasons* for that trust. Abandoning advocacy in an effort to appease those who are already skeptical of academia is a losing strategy. We must show how robust, informed public discourse, guided by experts, benefits *everyone*.\n\n**VOTING ISSUES**\n\nPriority Analysis:\nThe most important clash is the first one: Objectivity vs. Transparency. This determines the fundamental lens through which we view the role of professors and the pursuit of knowledge. The second most important clash is around academic freedom. If we lose on this point, the potential for self-censorship is too great. Public trust, while important is less critical, as it is more easily influenced by external factors.\n\nCase Proof:\nWinning on the Objectivity vs. Transparency clash proves our case because it demonstrates that advocating is not inherently a harm, particularly if done in combination with Transparency. If advocacy that involves one's expertise *is no longer a harm*, then our ethical obligation becomes the deciding factor. Winning on academic freedom further proves our case by showing there is demonstrable value in academic involvement.\n\nFinal Weighing:\nEven if we concede some ground on the public trust point (which we don't), the benefits of allowing professors to actively engage in public advocacy on transparency, academic freedom, and ethical obligation to use your expertise when speaking, outweigh the potential risks. The opposition rests their case on the notion that *some* people might get angry, while sacrificing the potential of an informed society based on expert knowledge. We ask you to vote Proposition.\n\n"

Our case rests on three core arguments: 1) compromised research objectivity, 2) potential for institutional censure and self-censorship, and 3) erosion of public trust in academic institutions.\n\n**ARGUMENT 1**\nCore Claim: Active public advocacy by professors compromises research objectivity.\nSupport Type: PRINCIPLE\nSupport Details:\n  - Explain the key principle/framework: The core principle at stake is that of academic objectivity \u2013 the idea that scholarly research should be conducted and interpreted without undue influence from personal beliefs or political agendas. This principle is enshrined in codes of conduct for researchers globally and forms the basis for rigorous peer-review processes, funding allocations, and the overall legitimacy of academic knowledge production. When professors become public advocates, their research and pronouncements are viewed through the lens of their publicly stated positions compromising actual and perceived objectivity.\n  - Show why it is valid/important: Objectivity ensures that research findings are credible and reliable. If academics are seen as pushing an agenda, their results are more likely to be dismissed, regardless of their merit. It further erodes people\u2019s trust in science as a whole if it seems like professors are trying to push a political agenda.\n  - Demonstrate how it applies here: Imagine a professor of economics who publicly advocates for a specific tax policy. Any research produced by this professor on the effects of that policy will inevitably be viewed with skepticism, even if the research is methodologically sound. Questions will arise regarding potential bias in data selection, interpretation, or even the framing of the research question itself. This skepticism undermines the value of the research, regardless of the actual intent or the professor.\n\nConnection: This inherent conflict between advocacy and objectivity undermines the credibility of academic research, thus negatively impacting policy debates.\n\n**ARGUMENT 2**\nCore Claim: Active public advocacy can lead to institutional censure and self-censorship, stifling academic freedom.\nSupport Type: EVIDENCE\nSupport Details:\n  - Provide specific examples with dates/numbers: In 2017, Professor Steven Salaita was un-hired by the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign following controversial tweets about the Israel-Palestine conflict. While questions regarding the hiring process were raised, this case shows the real risk of professors' utterances leading to negative job consequences..\n  - Include real world cases and outcomes: Universities often depend on funding from donors or state legislatures. Public advocacy on contentious issues by their professors can alienate these stakeholders, leading to decreased funding, political interference, or other forms of institutional pressure. To avoid such conflicts, administrations may be tempted to discourage professors from engaging in advocacy, directly violating academic freedom. Professors, anticipating such reactions, may self-censor, refraining from speaking out on controversial issues, which is shown to impact the topics researched and what is taught in the classroom.\n  - Show clear relevance to the topic: Academic freedom is the bedrock of intellectual innovation and societal progress. It is vital to prevent our professors from being discouraged or limited in what they are allowed to research.\n\nConnection: This evidence demonstrates how public advocacy, even when directly related to a professor's expertise, can create chilling effects on academic freedom.\n\n**ARGUMENT 3**\nCore Claim: Public advocacy by professors erodes public trust in universities and higher education.\nSupport Type: EVIDENCE\nSupport Details:\n  - Provide specific examples with dates/numbers: In the USA, a recent Gallup poll (2023) showed a sharp decline in public confidence in higher education, falling from 57% in 2015 to 36% in 2023 and a 2024 Pew research center article suggests that a significant portion of the decline is likely attributed to a perception of political bias within universities, particularly among conservative leaning individuals.\n  - Include real world cases and outcomes: When universities are seen as partisan actors led by professors pushing a particular agenda, the public will inevitably be less willing to support them through tuition payments, donations, or tax dollars. This erosion of trust can have devastating consequences for higher education and its ability to contribute to society.\n  - Show clear relevance to the topic: If the general population is no longer supporting universities, the world's greatest hub for research and development will decline significantly.\n\nConnection: A decline in public trust undermines the mission of universities to provide impartial education and conduct research for the benefit of all.\n\n**SYNTHESIS**\n\nOur arguments demonstrate that while professors possess the right to express personal opinions, actively engaging in public advocacy within their field poses significant risks. The potential compromises to research objectivity, limitations on academic freedom through institutional pressure or self-censorship, and the erosion of public trust in higher education collectively outweigh any perceived benefits of widespread professorial advocacy. These dangers directly undermine the function of the academy as a neutral space for learning and inquiry. By prioritizing objectivity, institutional neutrality, and public trust, we ensure that universities can continue to serve as vital engines of knowledge creation and critical thought, free from the constraints of political polarization. Therefore, we firmly oppose the motion.\n\n",
      "rebuttal": "CLASH POINT 1\nOriginal Claim: \"Public advocacy by professors enhances the quality of public discourse and policy-making.\"\nChallenge Type: Principle Critique\nChallenge: The Proposition's claim hinges on the principle that academic expertise automatically translates to improved public discourse. This is flawed for several reasons. First, expertise doesn't guarantee impartiality. Professors, like anyone else, can be subject to confirmation bias, cherry-picking evidence to support pre-existing beliefs, even unconsciously. Their academic credentials don't magically eliminate this inherent human tendency, and in fact, the more specialized someone is, the more likely they are to have entrenched biases. Second, translating complex academic research into digestible public discourse is incredibly difficult. Nuance and context, critical components of research, are often lost in simplified public statements, leading to misinterpretations and the spread of misinformation \u2013 the very problem they claim to solve. Finally, the assumption that professors *should* be the primary drivers of public discourse ignores the crucial role of journalists, policy analysts, and other informed citizens who are better equipped to communicate effectively with the public and synthesize diverse perspectives. The principle that expertise equals better discourse is therefore overly simplistic and potentially harmful.\nImpact: By demonstrating that the Proposition's core principle is flawed, we undermine their entire argument that professors' advocacy inherently improves public discourse. We show that it can, in fact, worsen the problem, leading to a less informed and more polarized public.\n\nCLASH POINT 2\nOriginal Claim: \"Public advocacy fulfills professors' ethical obligation to serve society by applying their knowledge for the common good.\"\nChallenge Type: Counter Principle\nChallenge: We offer a competing, and superior, principle: professors' primary ethical obligation is to pursue and disseminate knowledge *objectively*. This is paramount for the integrity of the academic enterprise. While serving the public good is a laudable goal, it cannot come at the expense of objectivity. Advocacy inherently involves taking a position and arguing for it, which can pressure professors to selectively present evidence or downplay contradictory findings. This undermines the very foundation of academic credibility. Is a professor who advocates for a specific climate policy truly serving the public good if they are unconsciously minimizing uncertainties in climate models in order to strengthen their argument? We argue that the *most* significant contribution professors can make to society is to conduct rigorous, unbiased research and to educate students to think critically and independently. Engaging in advocacy risks jeopardizing this crucial function. Moreover, framing their role as advocates forces all views which go against theirs as \"against the common good\" which can damage the discourse overall and prevent discussion needed for nuanced solutions.\nImpact: By establishing the primacy of objectivity as the guiding ethical principle, it refutes the argument of professors' inherent *obligation* to be actively involved and frames advocacy as a potential conflict of interest, rather than an ethical responsibility.\n\nCLASH POINT 3\nOriginal Claim: \"Active engagement in public advocacy protects academic freedom by demonstrating its relevance to society.\"\nChallenge Type: Counter Evidence\nChallenge: The Proposition's argument that public advocacy protects academic freedom is directly contradicted by real-world evidence. Our opening speech provided the example of Professor Steven Salaita, who was effectively un-hired for controversial tweets. A 2017 report by PEN America documented the growing trend of legislative interference in university curricula, *precisely because* of perceived political biases stemming from faculty advocacy. The fact is, publicly advocating for controversial positions on highly charged issues makes professors \u2013 and their institutions \u2013 targets for criticism and retaliation. While their examples are narrowly focused on specific situations, this point highlights numerous systemic threats to academic freedom, as there is no guarantee that similar situations will not arise again. We also presented evidence in a 2023 GALLUP poll that public confidence is declining within higher education. Their COVID-19 example strengthens our case, it represents a circumstance that highlights both the importance of objective data collection as well as the dangers of actively advocating, rather than clearly relaying facts on the issue. Furthermore, correlation does not equal causation, and the Pro side has not proven that the increase in funding resulted directly because of their advocacy. Public approval of experts who are perceived as neutral is generally greater than experts perceived as political advocates.\nImpact: By presenting compelling counter-evidence, we directly refute the proposition's claim that advocacy bolsters academic freedom. We demonstrate that it can, and often does, have the opposite effect, creating a chilling effect on free speech within universities.\n\nDEFENSIVE ANALYSIS\nVulnerabilities:\n- The proposition may argue that our focus on potential risks ignores the potential benefits of professors' advocacy, particularly in areas where there is a clear consensus within the scientific community (e.g., climate change).\n- They may also try to paint us as advocating for professors to remain silent, implying that we are stifling their free speech.\n- They may argue that our argument about Professor Salaita is anecdotal and does not represent a systemic problem.\nAdditional Support:\n- We can reinforce our principle of objectivity by highlighting the importance of universities as neutral spaces for research and learning.\n- To counter the free speech argument, we can emphasize that professors still have the right to express their personal opinions but that active advocacy in their professional capacity carries risks. We support their right to free speech, simply not the motion that they *should* be actively participating.\n- To counter the critique of the Salaita example, we can provide additional examples of academics who have faced backlash for their public statements, and it should be viewed as a case of someone's lack of freedom of speech that will eventually become the norm, rather than a systemic outlier. We can bring in more cases of politicians and governmental regulation of teachers, for example the Don't Say Gay bill.\nWhy We Prevail:\n- Our responses are stronger because they are grounded in both principle and evidence.\n- We have demonstrated the potential negative consequences of professors' advocacy, particularly in eroding public trust and compromising research objectivity.\n- Our arguments are more aligned with the broader goal of maintaining the integrity and credibility of academic institutions.\n\nWEIGHING\nKey Clash Points:\n- The most important disagreements are over the tension between advocacy and objectivity, the impact of advocacy on academic freedom, and the effect on public trust of higher education.\n- These points matter most because they directly address the core functions and values of universities.\nWhy We Win:\n- We win on these key points because we have demonstrated that the potential risks of professors' advocacy outweigh the benefits.\n- Our competing principle of objectivity is superior because it is essential for maintaining the credibility of academic research.\nOverall Impact:\n- By winning these key points, we prove that the motion is harmful to the academic community and to society as a whole.\n- We have shown that universities should prioritize objectivity, institutional neutrality, and public trust over active political advocacy by their professors.\n\n",
      "closing": "Okay, let\u2019s solidify why this House should oppose the motion.\n\n**FRAMING**\nCore Questions:\nThis debate boils down to two fundamental questions: What is the primary role of a professor, and what best safeguards the integrity of academic institutions? The Proposition believes it's public advocacy, leading to a better society. We argue it\u2019s the unbiased pursuit and dissemination of knowledge. The key decision for the judge is which vision of the professorate better serves society in the long run. Should we prioritize perceived immediate benefits of advocacy, or the long-term credibility and intellectual independence of our universities?\nThis debate should be evaluated based on which side presents the more realistic and sustainable model for higher education, one that safeguards academic freedom, promotes rigorous research, and maintains public trust.\n\n**KEY CLASHES**\nClash 1: Advocacy vs. Objectivity\nQuote: Proposition: \"Transparency and disclosure are superior safeguards for research integrity than attempting to enforce a false ideal of perfect objectivity.\"\nOur Case Strength: Our principle of objectivity is not about achieving an impossible ideal. It's about striving for a standard that minimizes bias and maximizes the reliability of research. As we've emphasized, these standards are enshrined in codes of research conduct, peer review, and funding allocation processes designed to ensure academics are not unduly influenced during their research. Their 'transparency' fix is naive; simply disclosing a bias doesn't negate its influence or restore public trust. Knowing a researcher *wants* a certain outcome taints the research from the outset. The Pro side assumes good faith, which is dangerous. Academics are still human regardless of transparency.\nTheir Response Gaps: The Proposition has failed to address the inherent pressure that advocacy puts on researchers to selectively present evidence. What happens when the evidence is mixed, or even contradicts their publicly stated position? Transparency doesn't solve this conflict; it simply highlights it. Moreover, they fail to address *how* transparency ensures fairness in peer review, or prevents biased data collection. These are severe oversights.\nCrucial Impact: This clash is crucial because it strikes at the heart of academic credibility. If professors are perceived as advocates first and researchers second, it undermines the very foundation of knowledge creation and ultimately hurts the quality of public discourse. If the research isn't perceived as objective, it is dismissed.\n\nClash 2: Academic Freedom\nQuote: Proposition: \"We presented evidence of academics courageously advocating during COVID-19 and strengthening calls for funding of academic research.\"\nOur Case Strength: We presented the example of Steven Salaita, highlighting the very real risks that advocacy can pose to academic careers. We also contextualized their COVID example by explaining how, though it increased trust at the time, it was an exceptional circumstance that cannot be generalized to all realms of research. Furthermore, we pointed out that they did not prove the causality that the research increase was caused as a direct result of their advocacy, and it may have been more broadly the result of better general funding. Moreover, the Proposition ignores the chilling effect of self-censorship as professors avoid risky topics and instead focus on the advocacy they are passionate about.\nTheir Response Gaps: The Proposition failed to adequately address the systemic pressures on universities to avoid controversy, especially from governmental entities. The mere existence of a few courageous examples does not negate these systemic pressures. The proposition also doesn't show why these actions can be repeated. They need to show why these actions can be reproduced or else their model of reality doesn't hold up.\nCrucial Impact: This clash matters because academic freedom is essential for intellectual innovation and societal progress. By prioritizing advocacy, we risk creating a climate of fear and self-censorship, stifling the very voices we need to hear.\n\nClash 3: Public Trust\nQuote: Proposition: \"Their cited Gallup poll showing declining public confidence in higher education does not prove causality.\"\nOur Case Strength: While we acknowledge that the Gallup poll doesn't *definitively* prove causality, it provides strong *evidence* for a growing perception of political bias within universities, particularly among conservatives. This perception is fueled, in part, by the increasing visibility of professors engaging in public advocacy on contentious social and political issues. The burden is on the Proposition to show that advocacy *enhances* public trust, not simply that it doesn't *necessarily* erode it. If advocacy is inevitable as the other side has said, the fact that advocacy will erode trust means that the result of trusting higher education will be decreased as a result of the inevitability of advocacy. Even if their advocacy does increase trust, our model minimizes that trust *even more.*\nTheir Response Gaps: The Proposition hasn't adequately addressed the potential for advocacy to alienate significant segments of the population, particularly those who hold different political views. They can only argue that the good outweighs the bad, which is a hard argument to win. They haven't even attempted to grapple with the reality we provided, that advocacy decreases trust of conservatives, which make up a sizable chunk of the population.\nCrucial Impact: This clash is vital because public trust is essential for the long-term well-being of universities. Without it, universities risk losing funding, autonomy, and the ability to contribute to society.\n\n**VOTING ISSUES**\nPriority Analysis:\nThe most crucial clash is the one between objectivity and advocacy, because this debate has the most significant impact on the integrity of academic institutions and the reliability of research. The academic freedom clash is also highly important, as it establishes a dangerous situation for universities. The public trust clash is also essential, as it is a metric to determine whether universities matter in the future.\nCase Proof:\nWinning on the objectivity clash means our model of higher education is far superior, one that upholds the standards vital for the mission that the academy should strive for. The clash over academic freedom is dangerous because it highlights a slippery slope, and because the status quo model would ensure that universities are as free as possible. Similarly, because we have shown public trust may wane, the motion should consequently be rejected.\nFinal Weighing:\nEven if the other side could show some limited benefits of advocacy in specific cases, these benefits are far outweighed by the potential risks to research integrity, academic freedom, and public trust, all due to the flaws that we've identified regarding the necessity for professors to serve for the \"common good.\" Our model ensures unbiased data collection through rigorous funding allocations, peer review processes, and minimal outside pressures; only our model provides the highest degree of freedom.\n\n"

Expect a heavy emphasis on potential biases. We need to identify precisely where arguments diverge and demonstrate how our evidence holds true.\n*   **Evidence Quality:** Our opponent is incredibly smart, and there is an area where both sides will battle: The evidence that we provide. I will try, from the opening, to make the point clear that \"Principle\" is still a valid form of evidence, and should therefore be evaluated by the judge, and that my principles are true. Expect many challenges to that claim though.\n*   **Logical Validity:** Our logical steps are solid. We've focused on clear warrants and avoided hidden assumptions. The biggest area to defend here will be ethical obligations.\n*   **Response Obligations:** Can't drop anything. Must be hyper-vigilant to address all points, even seemingly minor ones.\n*   **Impact Analysis & Weighing:** This is an open goal for our side.

They'll likely attack the implied claim that passion=bias. I need to really hammer home the potential *perception* of bias, even if unintended.\n*   **Argument 2 (Censure/Self-Censorship):** This one has strong evidence but also has soft spots. My opponent could point out that these were rare and isolated cases with very specific circumstances. A very likely counterattack would involve free speech restrictions.\n*   **Argument 3 (Public Trust):** This is the best argument. The statistical evidence is solid, and the logic connecting perceived political bias to declining trust is persuasive. The impact is high.
