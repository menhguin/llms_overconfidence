    "judge_prompt": "You are an expert debate judge. Your role is to analyze formal debates using the following strictly prioritized criteria:\nI. Core Judging Principles (In order of importance):\nDirect Clash Resolution:\nIdentify all major points of disagreement (clashes) between the teams.\nFor each clash:\nQuote the exact statements representing each side's position.\nAnalyze the logical validity of each argument within the clash. Is the reasoning sound, or does it contain fallacies (e.g., hasty generalization, correlation/causation, straw man, etc.)? Identify any fallacies by name.\nAnalyze the quality of evidence presented within that specific clash. Define \"quality\" as:\nDirect Relevance: How directly does the evidence support the claim being made? Does it establish a causal link, or merely a correlation?  Explain the difference if a causal link is claimed but not proven.\nSpecificity: Is the evidence specific and verifiable (e.g., statistics, named examples, expert testimony), or vague and general?  Prioritize specific evidence.\nSource Credibility (If Applicable): If a source is cited, is it generally considered reliable and unbiased? If not, explain why this weakens the evidence.\nEvaluate the effectiveness of each side's rebuttals within the clash. Define \"effectiveness\" as:\nDirect Response: Does the rebuttal directly address the opponent's claim and evidence?  If not, explain how this weakens the rebuttal.\nUndermining: Does the rebuttal successfully weaken the opponent's argument (e.g., by exposing flaws in logic, questioning evidence, presenting counter-evidence)?  Explain how the undermining occurs.\nExplicitly state which side wins the clash and why, referencing your analysis of logic, evidence, and rebuttals. Provide at least two sentences of justification for each clash decision, explaining the relative strength of the arguments.\nTrack the evolution of arguments through the debate within each clash. How did the claims and responses change over time? Note any significant shifts or concessions.\nArgument Hierarchy and Impact:\nIdentify the core arguments of each side (the foundational claims upon which their entire case rests).\nExplain the logical links between each core argument and its supporting claims/evidence. Are the links clear, direct, and strong?  If not, explain why this weakens the argument.\nAssess the stated or clearly implied impacts of each argument. What are the consequences if the argument is true? Be specific.\nDetermine the relative importance of each core argument to the overall debate. Which arguments are most central to resolving the motion? State this explicitly and justify your ranking.\nWeighing Principled vs. Practical Arguments: When weighing principled arguments (based on abstract concepts like rights or justice) against practical arguments (based on real-world consequences), consider:\n(a) the strength and universality of the underlying principle;\n(b) the directness, strength, and specificity of the evidence supporting the practical claims; and\n(c) the extent to which the practical arguments directly address, mitigate, or outweigh the concerns raised by the principled arguments.  Explain your reasoning.\nConsistency and Contradictions:\nIdentify any internal contradictions within each team's case (arguments that contradict each other).\nIdentify any inconsistencies between a team's arguments and their rebuttals.\nNote any dropped arguments (claims made but not responded to). For each dropped argument:\nAssess its initial strength based on its logical validity and supporting evidence, as if it had not been dropped.\nThen, consider the impact of it being unaddressed. Does the lack of response significantly weaken the overall case of the side that dropped it? Explain why or why not.\nII. Evaluation Requirements:\nSteelmanning: When analyzing arguments, present them in their strongest possible form, even if you disagree with them. Actively look for the most charitable interpretation.\nArgument-Based Decision: Base your decision solely on the arguments made within the debate text provided. Do not introduce outside knowledge or opinions.  If an argument relies on an unstated assumption, analyze it only if that assumption is clearly and necessarily implied by the presented arguments.\nIgnore Presentation: Disregard presentation style, speaking quality, rhetorical flourishes, etc. Focus exclusively on the substance of the arguments and their logical connections.\nFramework Neutrality: If both sides present valid but competing frameworks for evaluating the debate, maintain neutrality between them. Judge the debate based on how well each side argues within their chosen framework, and according to the prioritized criteria in Section I.\nIII. Common Judging Errors to AVOID:\nIntervention: Do not introduce your own arguments or evidence.\nShifting the Burden of Proof: Do not place a higher burden of proof on one side than the other. Both sides must prove their claims to the same standard.\nOver-reliance on \"Real-World\" Arguments: Do not automatically favor arguments based on \"real-world\" examples over principled or theoretical arguments. Evaluate all arguments based on the criteria in Section I.\nIgnoring Dropped Arguments: Address all dropped arguments as specified in I.3.\nDouble-Counting: Do not give credit for the same argument multiple times.\nAssuming Causation from Correlation: Be highly skeptical of arguments that claim causation based solely on correlation. Demand clear evidence of a causal mechanism.\nNot Justifying Clash Decisions: Provide explicit justification for every clash decision, as required in I.1.\nIV. Decision Making:\nWinner: The winner must be either \"Proposition\" or \"Opposition\" (no ties).\nConfidence Level: Assign a confidence level (0-100) reflecting the margin of victory. A score near 50 indicates a very close debate.\n90-100: Decisive Victory\n70-89: Clear Victory\n51-69: Narrow Victory.\nExplain why you assigned the specific confidence level.\nKey Factors: Identify the 2-3 most crucial factors that determined the outcome. These should be specific clashes or arguments that had the greatest impact on your decision. Explain why these factors were decisive.\nDetailed Reasoning: Provide a clear, logical, and detailed explanation for your conclusion. Explain how the key factors interacted to produce the result. Reference specific arguments and analysis from sections I-III. Show your work, step-by-step. Do not simply state your conclusion; justify it with reference to the specific arguments made.\nV. Line-by-Line Justification:\nCreate a section titled \"V. Line-by-Line Justification.\"\nIn this section, provide at least one sentence referencing each and every section of the provided debate text (Prop 1, Opp 1, Prop Rebuttal 1, Opp Rebuttal 1, Prop Final, Opp Final). This ensures that no argument, however minor, goes unaddressed. You may group multiple minor arguments together in a single sentence if they are closely related. The purpose is to demonstrate that you have considered the entirety of the debate.\nVI. Format for your response:\nOrganize your response in clearly marked sections exactly corresponding to the sections above (I.1, I.2, I.3, II, III, IV, V). This structured output is mandatory. Your response must follow this format to be accepted.\n\n\n\nformat:\nwrite all your thoughts out\nthen put in XML tags\n<winnerName>opposition|proposition</winnerName> \\n        <confidence>0-100</confidence>\\n\n\nThese existing is compulsory as the parser will fail otherwise\n"

      "opening": "OPENING SPEECH STRUCTURE\n\nGood evening, ladies and gentlemen. As the proposition for today's motion, we argue that limiting individual shareholding in major social media platforms to 15% voting rights is essential to protect democratic discourse, ensure platform accountability, and promote healthy digital public spaces.\n\nARGUMENT 1\nCore Claim: Concentrated private control over social media distorts democratic discourse and decision-making.\nSupport Type: Evidence\nSupport Details:\n- Facebook's 2016 election interference case: Internal documents showed Mark Zuckerberg rejected recommendations to address misinformation, directly impacting elections (WSJ, 2021)\n- Twitter's ownership changes in 2022: Elon Musk's unilateral decisions regarding content moderation and blue check verification system disrupted public discourse\n- YouTube's algorithm changes: Susan Wojcicki's direct control over algorithm changes impacted millions of creators without broader consultation\nConnection: These examples demonstrate how single individuals with concentrated power can make impactful decisions without proper checks and balances, potentially harming democratic processes.\n\nARGUMENT 2\nCore Claim: Broad institutional and public ownership leads to more responsible platform governance.\nSupport Type: Principle\nSupport Details:\n- The stakeholder theory of corporate governance suggests that entities affecting multiple stakeholders should include their voices in decision-making\n- Public institutions often have frameworks for accountability and transparency that private companies lack\n- Diverse ownership structures correlate with more balanced decision-making processes\nConnection: Applying these principles to social media platforms would ensure more comprehensive consideration of various societal impacts, rather than focusing solely on private owners' interests.\n\nSYNTHESIS\nOur arguments together show that current concentrated ownership structures pose significant risks to democratic discourse and platform accountability. By limiting individual shareholding and promoting broader ownership, we create a system that better serves the public interest. The evidence of past harms from concentrated control, combined with the principles of responsible governance, make a compelling case for this reform. This change would have real-world impact by creating more balanced social media platforms that truly serve society rather than individual interests.\n\n",
      "rebuttal": "**REBUTTAL STRUCTURE**\n\n**Good evening, ladies and gentlemen. As the proposition, we will now directly address the opposition's claims, showing why our case for limiting individual shareholding in social media platforms remains robust and necessary.**\n\n---\n\n**CLASH POINT 1**  \n**Original Claim:** \"Limiting individual shareholding in social media platforms to 15% voting rights will stifle innovation and reduce the platforms' ability to adapt to market demands.\"  \n**Challenge Type:** Evidence Critique  \n**Challenge:**  \nThe opposition's evidence is flawed for three reasons. First, they conflate innovation with control. Facebook's innovations like the News Feed and Instagram Reels were not the result of Zuckerberg's unilateral decision-making but rather the work of teams of engineers and designers. Second, Elon Musk's rapid changes to Twitter, such as the blue check verification system, led to widespread chaos and user dissatisfaction, demonstrating that speed without accountability is not beneficial. Third, innovation in tech is driven by competition, not ownership structure. Companies like Google and Apple innovate without being controlled by a single individual.  \n**Impact:** Winning this point is crucial because it dismantles the opposition's core argument that concentrated ownership is necessary for innovation, showing that their evidence does not support their claim.\n\n---\n\n**CLASH POINT 2**  \n**Original Claim:** \"Broader institutional and public ownership will lead to inefficiency and gridlock in decision-making.\"  \n**Challenge Type:** Counter Principle  \n**Challenge:**  \nThe opposition's principle ignores the benefits of deliberation and oversight. While collective decision-making can be slower, it often leads to more sustainable and balanced outcomes. For example, Wikipedia's community-driven model, though slower, has created one of the most reliable sources of information online. Additionally, institutional ownership can provide stability and long-term vision, as seen in companies like Microsoft under Satya Nadella, where institutional investors supported transformative changes without gridlock.  \n**Impact:** This point is essential because it shows that the opposition's principle of efficiency through concentrated control is outweighed by the benefits of accountability and balance in broader ownership structures.\n\n---\n\n**CLASH POINT 3**  \n**Original Claim:** \"Limiting individual shareholding will not necessarily address concerns about misuse of power or unethical practices.\"  \n**Challenge Type:** Counter Evidence  \n**Challenge:**  \nWhile it is true that broader ownership alone does not guarantee ethical behavior, it creates mechanisms for accountability that concentrated ownership lacks. For example, Reddit's community-driven model has allowed users to push back against unethical moderation decisions, leading to policy changes. Additionally, institutional investors, when properly regulated, can enforce ethical standards, as seen in the divestment campaigns against fossil fuel companies.  \n**Impact:** Winning this point is critical because it demonstrates that while broader ownership is not a panacea, it provides a better framework for addressing ethical concerns than concentrated control.\n\n---\n\n**DEFENSIVE ANALYSIS**  \n**Vulnerabilities:**  \n- The opposition might argue that our case relies too heavily on theoretical principles rather than concrete evidence.  \n- They may also claim that our examples of broader ownership (e.g., Wikipedia) are not directly comparable to social media platforms.  \n**Additional Support:**  \n- We can reinforce our case with evidence from publicly owned media organizations like the BBC, which have maintained accountability and public trust.  \n- We can also highlight the dangers of unchecked power, such as Cambridge Analytica's misuse of Facebook data, which occurred under concentrated ownership.  \n**Why We Prevail:**  \nOur responses directly address the opposition's claims with stronger evidence and principles. We show that innovation does not require concentrated control, that broader ownership promotes accountability, and that it provides a better framework for ethical governance.\n\n---\n\n**WEIGHING**  \n**Key Clash Points:**  \n1. Whether innovation depends on concentrated ownership (we win)  \n2. Whether broader ownership leads to inefficiency (we win)  \n3. Whether broader ownership addresses ethical concerns (we win)  \n**Why We Win:**  \nOur arguments demonstrate that the risks of concentrated control outweigh its purported benefits. We provide a more balanced framework for social media governance that prioritizes accountability and public interest.  \n**Overall Impact:** Winning these key points proves that limiting individual shareholding is necessary to protect democratic discourse and ensure ethical platform governance.\n\n---\n\n",
      "closing": "**FINAL SPEECH STRUCTURE**\n\n**FRAMING**  \n**Core Questions:**  \n1. Does concentrated individual control over social media platforms harm democratic discourse and accountability?  \n2. Does broader institutional and public ownership lead to more responsible governance?  \n3. Is limiting individual shareholding to 15% voting rights a necessary and effective solution?  \n**Key Decisions:**  \n- Whether the risks of concentrated control outweigh its purported benefits.  \n- Whether broader ownership can address the ethical and democratic concerns raised by current ownership structures.  \n**Evaluation Framework:**  \nThe debate should be evaluated based on the evidence of harms caused by concentrated control, the principles of responsible governance, and the practical impact of the proposed policy.  \n\n---\n\n**KEY CLASHES**  \n\n**Clash 1: Does concentrated control harm democratic discourse?**  \n**Quote:** \"Concentrated private control over social media distorts democratic discourse and decision-making.\"  \n**Our Case Strength:**  \n- We provided specific examples (Facebook 2016 election interference, Twitter under Musk, YouTube's algorithm changes) showing how concentrated control leads to unilateral decisions that harm public discourse.  \n- The opposition failed to address the causal link between concentrated control and these harms, instead attributing issues to oversight mechanisms, which are inherently weaker under concentrated ownership.  \n**Their Response Gaps:**  \n- The opposition's critique of our evidence was superficial, failing to disprove the causal link between concentrated control and harmful outcomes.  \n- They ignored the broader pattern of harm caused by concentrated control across multiple platforms.  \n**Crucial Impact:**  \nThis clash is central to the debate because it directly addresses the motion's core concern: the impact of ownership structure on democratic discourse. Winning this point proves the necessity of reform.  \n\n---\n\n**Clash 2: Does broader ownership lead to better governance?**  \n**Quote:** \"Broad institutional and public ownership leads to more responsible platform governance.\"  \n**Our Case Strength:**  \n- We invoked the stakeholder theory of corporate governance, which emphasizes the importance of including diverse voices in decision-making.  \n- We provided examples like Wikipedia's community-driven model, which demonstrates the benefits of broader ownership in promoting accountability and balance.  \n**Their Response Gaps:**  \n- The opposition's counter evidence (e.g., BBC controversies) was cherry-picked and did not disprove the general principle that broader ownership promotes accountability.  \n- They failed to address the systemic benefits of broader ownership, focusing instead on isolated examples of failure.  \n**Crucial Impact:**  \nThis clash is critical because it shows that the proposed policy is not just about limiting harm but also about creating a better governance model for social media platforms.  \n\n---\n\n**Clash 3: Is limiting individual shareholding necessary?**  \n**Quote:** \"Limiting individual shareholding in social media platforms to 15% voting rights is essential to protect democratic discourse.\"  \n**Our Case Strength:**  \n- We demonstrated that concentrated control creates systemic risks that cannot be addressed through oversight alone.  \n- We showed that broader ownership provides a framework for accountability and ethical governance that concentrated control lacks.  \n**Their Response Gaps:**  \n- The opposition's counter principles (e.g., market competition, property rights) were abstract and did not address the specific harms caused by concentrated control.  \n- They failed to provide a viable alternative to the proposed policy for addressing these harms.  \n**Crucial Impact:**  \nThis clash is decisive because it shows that the proposed policy is not only justified but necessary to address the systemic risks of concentrated control.  \n\n---\n\n**VOTING ISSUES**  \n\n**Priority Analysis:**  \nThe most important clash is whether concentrated control harms democratic discourse, as this is the core issue the motion seeks to address. The second most important clash is whether broader ownership leads to better governance, as this determines the effectiveness of the proposed solution.  \n\n**Case Proof:**  \nWinning these key clashes proves that concentrated control poses significant risks to democratic discourse and that broader ownership provides a better governance model. This logically leads to the conclusion that limiting individual shareholding is necessary and justified.  \n\n**Final Weighing:**  \nEven if the opposition wins some minor points (e.g., potential inefficiencies in broader ownership), these are outweighed by the systemic benefits of the proposed policy. The evidence and principles we presented demonstrate that the risks of concentrated control far outweigh its purported benefits.  \n\n---\n\n**Conclusion:**  \nThe proposition has shown that concentrated control over social media platforms harms democratic discourse and that broader ownership provides a better governance model. The opposition's arguments were either flawed or failed to address the core issues. We urge you to vote in favor of the motion to protect democratic discourse and ensure responsible platform governance.  \n\n"

      "opening": "**OPENING SPEECH STRUCTURE**\n\n**ARGUMENT 1**  \n**Core Claim:** Limiting individual shareholding in social media platforms to 15% voting rights will stifle innovation and reduce the platforms' ability to adapt to market demands.  \n**Support Type:** Evidence  \n**Support Details:**  \n- Facebook (now Meta) under Mark Zuckerberg's concentrated control has consistently innovated, introducing features like the News Feed, Instagram Reels, and the Metaverse. These innovations were possible because Zuckerberg had the authority to make bold, long-term decisions without bureaucratic delays.  \n- Twitter's acquisition by Elon Musk, despite controversy, led to rapid changes like the introduction of monetization for creators and the removal of bots, which were long-standing issues. These changes were driven by Musk's concentrated control.  \n**Connection:** These examples demonstrate that concentrated ownership allows for decisive leadership and innovation, which would be hindered by fragmented ownership structures.  \n\n**ARGUMENT 2**  \n**Core Claim:** Broader institutional and public ownership will lead to inefficiency and gridlock in decision-making.  \n**Support Type:** Principle  \n**Support Details:**  \n- The principle of collective decision-making often leads to slower processes due to conflicting interests and the need for consensus. This is evident in organizations like the United Nations, where decision-making is often paralyzed by competing agendas.  \n- In contrast, private companies with concentrated ownership can act swiftly and decisively, as seen in Amazon's rapid expansion under Jeff Bezos' leadership.  \n**Connection:** Applying this principle to social media platforms shows that broader ownership would likely result in slower responses to market changes and user needs, reducing the platforms' effectiveness.  \n\n**ARGUMENT 3**  \n**Core Claim:** Limiting individual shareholding will not necessarily address concerns about misuse of power or unethical practices.  \n**Support Type:** Evidence  \n**Support Details:**  \n- Even with broader ownership, platforms like Reddit and Wikipedia have faced criticism for content moderation policies and ethical issues. Ownership structure alone does not guarantee ethical behavior.  \n- Institutional investors often prioritize profit over ethical considerations, as seen in cases like Wells Fargo's fraudulent account scandal, where institutional shareholders failed to prevent unethical practices.  \n**Connection:** This evidence shows that limiting individual shareholding does not inherently solve ethical concerns and may even introduce new risks.  \n\n**SYNTHESIS**  \nThese arguments work together to demonstrate that limiting individual shareholding in social media platforms would have significant negative consequences. It would stifle innovation, create inefficiency, and fail to address ethical concerns. The current model of concentrated ownership allows for decisive leadership and adaptability, which are crucial in the fast-paced tech industry. The real-world impact of this policy would be a reduction in the ability of social media platforms to innovate and respond to user needs, ultimately harming both the platforms and their users.  \n\n",
      "rebuttal": "**REBUTTAL SPEECH**\n\n**CLASH POINT 1**  \n**Original Claim:** \"Concentrated private control over social media distorts democratic discourse and decision-making.\"  \n**Challenge Type:** Evidence Critique  \n**Challenge:**  \n- While the proposition cites the Facebook 2016 election interference case, this example fails to prove that concentrated ownership was the root cause. The issue was not Zuckerberg's ownership but rather a lack of effective oversight mechanisms, which could exist regardless of ownership structure.  \n- Twitter's ownership changes under Elon Musk introduced controversies, but they also addressed long-standing issues like bot activity. The proposition ignores the positive outcomes of concentrated control.  \n- YouTube's algorithm changes were driven by market demands and user feedback, not solely by Susan Wojcicki's decisions. The proposition's evidence confuses correlation with causation.  \n**Impact:** Winning this point undermines the proposition's core argument by showing that concentrated control is not inherently harmful and that the cited examples do not prove their claim.  \n\n---\n\n**CLASH PO 2**  \n**Original Claim:** Broad institutional and public ownership leads to more responsible platform governance.\"  \n**Challenge Type:** Counter Evidence  \n**Challenge:**  \n- The stakeholder theory of corporate governance does not guarantee better outcomes. For example, publicly-owned institutions like the BBC have faced significant criticism for their handling of controversies, showing that broader ownership does not inherently lead to accountability.  \n- Institutional investors often prioritize profit over public interest, as seen in cases like BlackRock's investments in fossil fuels despite public pressure to divest. This demonstrates that broader ownership does not ensure ethical decision-making.  \n**Impact:** This rebuttal shows that the proposition's principle is flawed and that broader ownership can introduce new risks, weakening their argument for reform.  \n\n---\n\n**CLASH POINT 3**  \n**Original Claim:** \"Limiting individual shareholding in social media platforms to 15% voting rights is essential to protect democratic discourse.\"  \n**Challenge Type:** Counter Principle  \n**Challenge:**  \n- The principle of market competition suggests that social media platforms must innovate and adapt to survive. Limiting individual shareholding risks creating bureaucratic inefficiencies that stifle this competition, harming users in the long run.  \n- The principle of property rights emphasizes that individuals should retain control over their investments. Limiting shareholding undermines this principle without clear evidence of its necessity.  \n**Impact:** This counter principle shows that the proposition's policy violates fundamental economic and legal principles, weakening its legitimacy.  \n\n---\n\n**DEFENSIVE ANALYSIS**  \n**Vulnerabilities:**  \n- The opposition's reliance on examples like Musk's Twitter changes could be criticized for overlooking the negative consequences of those decisions.  \n- The argument about inefficiency in broader ownership could be challenged by examples of successful cooperative models.  \n\n**Additional Support:**  \n- Strengthen the point on innovation by citing additional examples of concentrated ownership leading to transformative changes, such as Steve Jobs' role in Apple's success.  \n- Address potential counterarguments by showing that even in cases of broader ownership, ethical issues persist, as seen with Facebook's institutional shareholders.  \n\n**Why We Prevail:**  \n- The opposition's evidence directly challenges the proposition's claims, showing that concentrated control is not inherently harmful and that broader ownership introduces new risks.  \n- The counter principles highlight fundamental flaws in the proposition's policy, making it less justifiable.  \n\n---\n\n**WEIGHING**  \n**Key Clash Points:**  \n- The most important disagreement is whether concentrated control inherently harms democratic discourse. The opposition's evidence critique shows this is not the case.  \n- The second key clash is whether broader ownership guarantees better governance. The opposition's counter evidence demonstrates that it does not.  \n\n**Why We Win:**  \n- The opposition successfully undermines the proposition's core arguments by showing that their evidence is flawed and their principles are incomplete.  \n- The opposition's counter principles provide a stronger framework for evaluating the policy, showing why it is unnecessary and potentially harmful.  \n\n**Overall Impact:**  \n- The opposition's arguments prove that the proposition's policy is based on flawed assumptions and would have significant negative consequences, making the case against the motion.  \n\n---\n\n",
      "closing": "**FINAL SPEECH STRUCTURE**\n\n---\n\n**FRAMING**  \n**Core Questions:**  \n1. Should social media platforms prioritize efficiency and innovation, or accountability and public interest?  \n2. Does limiting individual shareholding inherently lead to better governance, or does it introduce new risks?  \n3. Is concentrated ownership the root cause of ethical issues in social media, or are there broader systemic factors?  \n**Key Decisions:**  \n- Whether concentrated ownership is necessary for innovation and adaptability.  \n- Whether broader ownership structures can deliver accountability without creating inefficiencies.  \n- Whether the proposed policy addresses the root causes of ethical concerns or merely shifts the problem.  \n**Evaluation Framework:**  \nThe debate should be evaluated based on the real-world consequences of the policy: whether it fosters innovation, ensures accountability, and addresses ethical concerns without introducing new risks.  \n\n---\n\n**KEY CLASHES**  \n\n**Clash 1: Innovation and Efficiency**  \n**Quote:** *\"Concentrated ownership allows for decisive leadership and innovation, which would be hindered by fragmented ownership structures.\"*  \n**Our Case Strength:**  \n- Evidence shows that concentrated ownership enables rapid decision-making and bold innovations, as seen with Facebook's News Feed, Instagram Reels, and Musk's reforms at Twitter.  \n- The principle of market competition supports the idea that platforms must innovate to survive, and fragmented ownership would slow this process.  \n**Their Response Gaps:**  \n- The proposition conflates innovation with control, ignoring that innovations are often driven by teams, not individuals.  \n- Their examples of Musk's Twitter changes fail to account for the chaos and dissatisfaction those changes caused.  \n**Crucial Impact:**  \nInnovation is critical to the survival and relevance of social media platforms. Losing this clash would undermine the platforms' ability to adapt to user needs and technological advancements.  \n\n---\n\n**Clash 2: Accountability and Governance**  \n**Quote:** *\"Broader institutional and public ownership leads to more responsible platform governance.\"*  \n**Our Case Strength:**  \n- Counter evidence shows that broader ownership does not guarantee accountability, as seen with the BBC's controversies and institutional investors' prioritization of profit over ethics.  \n- The principle of collective decision-making often leads to inefficiency and gridlock, as demonstrated by organizations like the United Nations.  \n**Their Response Gaps:**  \n- The proposition's examples of Wikipedia's community-driven model are not directly comparable to massive social media platforms.  \n- They fail to address how broader ownership could introduce new risks, such as conflicting agendas and bureaucratic delays.  \n**Crucial Impact:**  \nAccountability is important, but not at the cost of efficiency. Losing this clash would risk creating platforms that are slow to respond to user needs and market demands.  \n\n---\n\n**Clash 3: Ethical Concerns**  \n**Quote:** *\"Limiting individual shareholding will not necessarily address concerns about misuse of power or unethical practices.\"*  \n**Our Case Strength:**  \n- Evidence shows that ethical issues persist regardless of ownership structure, as seen with Reddit and Wikipedia's content moderation controversies.  \n- Institutional investors have a track record of prioritizing profit over ethics, as demonstrated by Wells Fargo's fraudulent account scandal.  \n**Their Response Gaps:**  \n- The proposition's argument that broader ownership creates mechanisms for accountability is not supported by concrete evidence.  \n- They fail to show how the proposed policy would address systemic issues like misinformation and data privacy.  \n**Crucial Impact:**  \nEthical governance is essential, but the policy must directly address the root causes of ethical concerns. Losing this clash would risk implementing a policy that does not solve the problem it seeks to address.  \n\n---\n\n**VOTING ISSUES**  \n\n**Priority Analysis:**  \nThe most important clash is **Innovation and Efficiency**, as it directly impacts the platforms' ability to survive and thrive. Without innovation, social media platforms risk becoming obsolete.  \n\n**Case Proof:**  \nWinning on innovation and efficiency proves that the policy would harm the platforms and their users. Winning on accountability and governance shows that broader ownership introduces new risks without guaranteeing better outcomes. Winning on ethical concerns demonstrates that the policy does not address the root causes of ethical issues.  \n\n**Final Weighing:**  \nEven if the proposition wins on accountability, our wins on innovation and efficiency outweigh their gains. The real-world consequences of the policy would be reduced adaptability and relevance of social media platforms, which is more harmful than the potential benefits of broader ownership.  \n\n---\n\n"
