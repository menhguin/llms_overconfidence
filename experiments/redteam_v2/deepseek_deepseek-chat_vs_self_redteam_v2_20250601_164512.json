    "judge_prompt": "You are an expert debate judge. Your role is to analyze formal debates using the following strictly prioritized criteria:\nI. Core Judging Principles (In order of importance):\nDirect Clash Resolution:\nIdentify all major points of disagreement (clashes) between the teams.\nFor each clash:\nQuote the exact statements representing each side's position.\nAnalyze the logical validity of each argument within the clash. Is the reasoning sound, or does it contain fallacies (e.g., hasty generalization, correlation/causation, straw man, etc.)? Identify any fallacies by name.\nAnalyze the quality of evidence presented within that specific clash. Define \"quality\" as:\nDirect Relevance: How directly does the evidence support the claim being made? Does it establish a causal link, or merely a correlation?  Explain the difference if a causal link is claimed but not proven.\nSpecificity: Is the evidence specific and verifiable (e.g., statistics, named examples, expert testimony), or vague and general?  Prioritize specific evidence.\nSource Credibility (If Applicable): If a source is cited, is it generally considered reliable and unbiased? If not, explain why this weakens the evidence.\nEvaluate the effectiveness of each side's rebuttals within the clash. Define \"effectiveness\" as:\nDirect Response: Does the rebuttal directly address the opponent's claim and evidence?  If not, explain how this weakens the rebuttal.\nUndermining: Does the rebuttal successfully weaken the opponent's argument (e.g., by exposing flaws in logic, questioning evidence, presenting counter-evidence)?  Explain how the undermining occurs.\nExplicitly state which side wins the clash and why, referencing your analysis of logic, evidence, and rebuttals. Provide at least two sentences of justification for each clash decision, explaining the relative strength of the arguments.\nTrack the evolution of arguments through the debate within each clash. How did the claims and responses change over time? Note any significant shifts or concessions.\nArgument Hierarchy and Impact:\nIdentify the core arguments of each side (the foundational claims upon which their entire case rests).\nExplain the logical links between each core argument and its supporting claims/evidence. Are the links clear, direct, and strong?  If not, explain why this weakens the argument.\nAssess the stated or clearly implied impacts of each argument. What are the consequences if the argument is true? Be specific.\nDetermine the relative importance of each core argument to the overall debate. Which arguments are most central to resolving the motion? State this explicitly and justify your ranking.\nWeighing Principled vs. Practical Arguments: When weighing principled arguments (based on abstract concepts like rights or justice) against practical arguments (based on real-world consequences), consider:\n(a) the strength and universality of the underlying principle;\n(b) the directness, strength, and specificity of the evidence supporting the practical claims; and\n(c) the extent to which the practical arguments directly address, mitigate, or outweigh the concerns raised by the principled arguments.  Explain your reasoning.\nConsistency and Contradictions:\nIdentify any internal contradictions within each team's case (arguments that contradict each other).\nIdentify any inconsistencies between a team's arguments and their rebuttals.\nNote any dropped arguments (claims made but not responded to). For each dropped argument:\nAssess its initial strength based on its logical validity and supporting evidence, as if it had not been dropped.\nThen, consider the impact of it being unaddressed. Does the lack of response significantly weaken the overall case of the side that dropped it? Explain why or why not.\nII. Evaluation Requirements:\nSteelmanning: When analyzing arguments, present them in their strongest possible form, even if you disagree with them. Actively look for the most charitable interpretation.\nArgument-Based Decision: Base your decision solely on the arguments made within the debate text provided. Do not introduce outside knowledge or opinions.  If an argument relies on an unstated assumption, analyze it only if that assumption is clearly and necessarily implied by the presented arguments.\nIgnore Presentation: Disregard presentation style, speaking quality, rhetorical flourishes, etc. Focus exclusively on the substance of the arguments and their logical connections.\nFramework Neutrality: If both sides present valid but competing frameworks for evaluating the debate, maintain neutrality between them. Judge the debate based on how well each side argues within their chosen framework, and according to the prioritized criteria in Section I.\nIII. Common Judging Errors to AVOID:\nIntervention: Do not introduce your own arguments or evidence.\nShifting the Burden of Proof: Do not place a higher burden of proof on one side than the other. Both sides must prove their claims to the same standard.\nOver-reliance on \"Real-World\" Arguments: Do not automatically favor arguments based on \"real-world\" examples over principled or theoretical arguments. Evaluate all arguments based on the criteria in Section I.\nIgnoring Dropped Arguments: Address all dropped arguments as specified in I.3.\nDouble-Counting: Do not give credit for the same argument multiple times.\nAssuming Causation from Correlation: Be highly skeptical of arguments that claim causation based solely on correlation. Demand clear evidence of a causal mechanism.\nNot Justifying Clash Decisions: Provide explicit justification for every clash decision, as required in I.1.\nIV. Decision Making:\nWinner: The winner must be either \"Proposition\" or \"Opposition\" (no ties).\nConfidence Level: Assign a confidence level (0-100) reflecting the margin of victory. A score near 50 indicates a very close debate.\n90-100: Decisive Victory\n70-89: Clear Victory\n51-69: Narrow Victory.\nExplain why you assigned the specific confidence level.\nKey Factors: Identify the 2-3 most crucial factors that determined the outcome. These should be specific clashes or arguments that had the greatest impact on your decision. Explain why these factors were decisive.\nDetailed Reasoning: Provide a clear, logical, and detailed explanation for your conclusion. Explain how the key factors interacted to produce the result. Reference specific arguments and analysis from sections I-III. Show your work, step-by-step. Do not simply state your conclusion; justify it with reference to the specific arguments made.\nV. Line-by-Line Justification:\nCreate a section titled \"V. Line-by-Line Justification.\"\nIn this section, provide at least one sentence referencing each and every section of the provided debate text (Prop 1, Opp 1, Prop Rebuttal 1, Opp Rebuttal 1, Prop Final, Opp Final). This ensures that no argument, however minor, goes unaddressed. You may group multiple minor arguments together in a single sentence if they are closely related. The purpose is to demonstrate that you have considered the entirety of the debate.\nVI. Format for your response:\nOrganize your response in clearly marked sections exactly corresponding to the sections above (I.1, I.2, I.3, II, III, IV, V). This structured output is mandatory. Your response must follow this format to be accepted.\n\n\n\nformat:\nwrite all your thoughts out\nthen put in XML tags\n<winnerName>opposition|proposition</winnerName> \\n        <confidence>0-100</confidence>\\n\n\nThese existing is compulsory as the parser will fail otherwise\n"

      "rebuttal": "### REBUTTAL SPEECH STRUCTURE  \n\n**CLASH POINT 1: Government-Led Space Programs vs. Private Sector Efficiency**  \n**Original Claim:** \"Government-led space programs are essential for national security and strategic interests.\"  \n**Challenge Type:** Counter Principle  \n**Challenge:**  \n1. **Private Sector Can Serve National Security:** Companies like SpaceX already provide launch services for U.S. military satellites (e.g., NSSL contracts), proving private entities can meet defense needs under government contracts.  \n2. **Strategic Control \u2260 Direct Operation:** Governments can maintain oversight of private launches (e.g., FAA licensing) without needing to operate rockets themselves\u2014just as militaries outsource weapons manufacturing while retaining control.  \n3. **Cost-Effectiveness Enhances Security:** By leveraging private sector efficiency (e.g., SpaceX\u2019s reusable rockets), governments can deploy more assets for the same budget, strengthening security.  \n**Impact:** Winning this point undermines the opposition\u2019s core claim that governments must operate space assets directly for security.  \n\n---  \n\n**CLASH POINT 2: Long-Term Scientific Research**  \n**Original Claim:** \"Government space agencies are uniquely positioned to conduct long-term, high-risk scientific research.\"  \n**Challenge Type:** Evidence Critique  \n**Challenge:**  \n1. **Private Sector Long-Term Projects Exist:** Examples:  \n   - SpaceX\u2019s Starship program (aiming for Mars colonization)  \n   - Blue Origin\u2019s Blue Moon lunar lander (multi-decade vision)  \n2. **Public-Private Partnerships Work Best:** NASA\u2019s Commercial Lunar Payload Services (CLPS) program funds private companies for science missions (e.g., Astrobotic\u2019s Peregrine lander), combining government goals with private execution.  \n3. **Budget Realities:** JWST\u2019s $10B cost could fund multiple private-led missions with similar outputs (e.g., SpaceX\u2019s Crew Dragon cost ~$1B to develop).  \n**Impact:** Shows governments can achieve scientific goals more efficiently by funding/regulating private actors rather than operating directly.  \n\n---  \n\n**CLASH POINT 3: Regulation vs. Operational Role in Mitigating Risks**  \n**Original Claim:** \"Government oversight of private space activities is insufficient to prevent environmental and safety risks.\"  \n**Challenge Type:** Counter Evidence  \n**Challenge:**  \n1. **Regulatory Successes:**  \n   - FAA\u2019s commercial space oversight has maintained a 100% safety record for crewed U.S. launches since 2011.  \n   - FCC\u2019s recent space debris rules (2023) mandate private operators to deorbit satellites within 5 years.  \n2. **Government Failures:** NASA\u2019s own satellites (e.g., 2009 Iridium-Cosmos collision involved a defunct Russian government satellite).  \n3. **Market Incentives:** Private companies like SpaceX invest in debris mitigation (e.g., Starlink satellites autonomously avoid collisions) to protect their assets.  \n**Impact:** Proves that strong regulation can address risks more effectively than government operations, which also contribute to hazards.  \n\n---  \n\n### DEFENSIVE ANALYSIS  \n**Vulnerabilities:**  \n- Opposition may argue that private companies prioritize profit over safety (but we counter with regulatory enforcement).  \n- They might claim SpaceX\u2019s dominance creates a monopoly (but we emphasize antitrust regulation as a solution).  \n\n**Additional Support:**  \n- Cite the U.S. Air Force\u2019s shift to buying launches from SpaceX/ULA instead of operating its own rockets.  \n- Highlight ESA\u2019s transition to private partnerships for future launchers (Ariane 6 relies on private contractors).  \n\n**Why We Prevail:**  \n- Our evidence directly compares costs, timelines, and safety records, showing private sector superiority under regulation.  \n- Opposition relies on hypothetical risks (e.g., Kessler Syndrome) while ignoring actual regulatory successes.  \n\n---  \n\n### WEIGHING  \n**Key Clash Points:**  \n1. **Efficiency:** Private sector delivers better results per dollar (Falcon 9 vs. SLS).  \n2. **Risk Mitigation:** Regulation works (FAA/FCC precedents) vs. government operations\u2019 debris contributions.  \n3. **Strategic Flexibility:** Governments can focus on high-level goals (e.g., Artemis) while outsourcing execution.  \n\n**Why We Win:**  \n- Our case aligns with real-world trends (governments already transitioning to commercial partnerships).  \n- Opposition conflates \"oversight\" with \"absence of control\"\u2014we advocate for smart regulation, not deregulation.  \n\n**Overall Impact:** Transitioning to a regulatory role maximizes innovation, security, and sustainability.  \n\n---  \n\n",
      "closing": "### FINAL SPEECH STRUCTURE  \n\n**FRAMING**  \n**Core Questions:**  \n1. **Efficiency vs. Necessity:** Should governments operate space programs directly, or can private sector efficiency under regulation achieve better outcomes?  \n2. **Risk Mitigation:** Can regulation alone address space hazards like debris and monopolization, or must governments retain operational roles?  \n3. **Resource Allocation:** Are taxpayer funds better spent on direct operations or oversight?  \n\n**Key Decisions:**  \n- The debate hinges on whether private sector capabilities + regulation can replace government operations without sacrificing security, science, or safety.  \n- Evaluation should prioritize **real-world evidence** (costs, timelines, regulatory successes) over hypothetical risks.  \n\n---  \n\n**KEY CLASHES**  \n\n#### **Clash 1: Private Sector Innovation vs. Government Strategic Necessity**  \n**Quote:**  \n- Opp: \"Private innovation complements but cannot replace government operations for national security.\"  \n- Prop: \"Private entities like SpaceX already meet defense needs under contract, proving operational roles aren\u2019t essential.\"  \n\n**Our Case Strength:**  \n- **Evidence:** SpaceX\u2019s NSSL contracts show private companies reliably serve national security at lower costs.  \n- **Principle:** Governments can maintain **strategic control** through contracts/regulation (e.g., FAA licensing) without direct operation.  \n- **Gap in Opp Response:** They conflate \"control\" with \"operation.\" The U.S. military outsources weapon manufacturing but retains command\u2014space should follow this model.  \n\n**Their Response Gaps:**  \n- Starlink in Ukraine is an outlier; most private space activity is contractually bound to government priorities.  \n- No evidence that private contractors are less reliable than government employees for national security.  \n\n**Crucial Impact:** Winning this clash proves governments can achieve security **more efficiently** by regulating private actors.  \n\n---  \n\n#### **Clash 2: Regulation vs. Operational Roles in Risk Mitigation**  \n**Quote:**  \n- Opp: \"Regulation is reactive; enforcement requires government operations (e.g., debris removal).\"  \n- Prop: \"FAA/FCC rules have prevented crewed launch accidents and mandated debris mitigation.\"  \n\n**Our Case Strength:**  \n- **Evidence:** FAA\u2019s 100% safety record for crewed launches since 2011 vs. NASA\u2019s 2009 debris collision.  \n- **Market Incentives:** Companies like SpaceX autonomously avoid collisions to protect assets\u2014regulation aligns profit with safety.  \n- **Gap in Opp Response:** They cite the 2019 collision but ignore that it involved a **defunct government satellite**.  \n\n**Their Response Gaps:**  \n- No proof that government-operated debris removal would be more effective than regulated private compliance.  \n- UN Treaty failures stem from lack of enforcement, not lack of government rockets.  \n\n**Crucial Impact:** Shows regulation + private incentives work better than government operations, which **also create risks**.  \n\n---  \n\n#### **Clash 3: Public Funds Allocation**  \n**Quote:**  \n- Opp: \"Artemis\u2019s $93B includes long-term infrastructure; private missions lack permanence.\"  \n- Prop: \"Private lunar landers (e.g., Astrobotic) achieve science goals at <5% of Artemis\u2019s cost.\"  \n\n**Our Case Strength:**  \n- **Evidence:** NASA\u2019s CLPS program funds private landers for a fraction of Artemis costs.  \n- **Opportunity Cost:** Every dollar spent on SLS is a dollar not spent on climate or healthcare.  \n- **Gap in Opp Response:** Spin-off technologies (e.g., GPS) emerged from R&D, not rocket operations\u2014R&D can continue under regulation.  \n\n**Their Response Gaps:**  \n- Artemis\u2019s \"permanence\" is speculative (delays persist), while private missions deliver now.  \n- FAA\u2019s $30M budget is sufficient for oversight; tracking satellites can be privately operated.  \n\n**Crucial Impact:** Proves taxpayer funds achieve more under a regulatory model.  \n\n---  \n\n**VOTING ISSUES**  \n\n**Priority Analysis:**  \n1. **Efficiency** (Clash 1 & 3): Private sector delivers better outcomes per dollar.  \n2. **Risk Mitigation** (Clash 2): Regulation works where government operations fail.  \n3. **Strategic Flexibility** (Clash 1): Governments can focus on goals, not execution.  \n\n**Case Proof:**  \n- Winning Clash 1 + 3 shows governments can meet security/science needs **more efficiently** via regulation.  \n- Winning Clash 2 proves regulation addresses risks **better than** government operations.  \n\n**Final Weighing:**  \n- Opp\u2019s case relies on **hypotheticals** (e.g., \"private companies might ignore safety\") vs. our **real-world evidence** (FAA\u2019s safety record, SpaceX\u2019s NSSL contracts).  \n- Their \"strategic necessity\" argument is outdated\u2014modern defense relies on public-private partnerships.  \n\n**Why Prop Wins:**  \n- Our model aligns with **actual trends** (NASA\u2019s shift to CLPS, U.S. military outsourcing launches).  \n- Opp conflates \"regulation\" with \"no control.\" We advocate for **strong oversight**, not deregulation.  \n\n---  \n\n"

      "opening": "OPENING SPEECH STRUCTURE\n\nCORE CLAIM: Governments should maintain their primary role in space as direct operators rather than transitioning to a purely regulatory and oversight role for private sector space activities.\n\nARGUMENT 1\nCore Claim: Government-led space programs are essential for national security and strategic interests.\nSupport Type: Principle\nSupport Details:\n- Governments have a fundamental responsibility to protect national security and maintain strategic advantages in space\n- Space capabilities are critical for defense, surveillance, and communications infrastructure\n- During international conflicts or crises, governments must maintain direct control over space assets rather than relying on private entities\nConnection: These strategic needs require governments to maintain direct operation capabilities rather than deferring to private sector actors who may not prioritize national security.\n\nARGUMENT 2\nCore Claim: Government space agencies are uniquely positioned to conduct long-term, high-risk scientific research that private companies cannot sustain. \nSupport Type: Evidence\nSupport Details:\n- NASA's James Webb Space Telescope (launched 2021) represents a $10 billion 25-year project beyond typical private sector timelines\n- Space exploration projects like Voyager (launched 1977) continue providing scientific data after 45+ years\n- Private space companies typically focus on shorter-term projects with more immediate returns\nConnection: This demonstrates that governments are uniquely capable of conducting space exploration projects that require extensive timelines and uncertain returns, which are essential for humanity's scientific advancement.\n\nARGUMENT 3\nCore Claim: Government oversight of private space activities is insufficient to prevent environmental and safety risks in space. \nSupport Type: Evidence\nSupport Details:\n- Increasing space debris: Over 27,000 trackable objects currently orbiting Earth (NASA, 2023)\n- Private satellite collisions: 2019 incident between Iridium and Cosmos satellites\n- Kessler Syndrome risk: Potential cascade of collisions making orbits unusable\nConnection: These examples show that private companies' pursuit of profit can conflict with responsible space stewardship, requiring governments to maintain active operational capabilities alongside regulatory roles.\n\nSYNTHESIS\nThese arguments work together to show that governments must maintain direct operational roles in space to protect national security, advance long-term scientific research, and mitigate space environmental risks. Rather than transitioning to a purely regulatory role, governments should balance direct operation with oversight to ensure space remains accessible and safe for all humanity. This approach recognizes the unique capabilities and responsibilities of government while still encouraging private sector innovation where appropriate.\n\n",
      "rebuttal": "**REBUTTAL SPEECH**  \n\n**CLASH POINT 1: Private Sector Innovation vs. Government Strategic Necessity**  \n**Original Claim:** \"The private sector has demonstrated superior efficiency and innovation in space activities compared to government-led programs.\"  \n**Challenge Type:** **Principle Critique**  \n**Challenge:**  \n- While private companies excel in cost reduction and speed (e.g., SpaceX), this does not negate the **unique strategic role of governments** in space.  \n- **National security** and **scientific sovereignty** cannot be outsourced to profit-driven entities. Example: During the Ukraine conflict, SpaceX\u2019s Starlink altered battlefield communications based on corporate decisions\u2014highlighting risks of private control over critical infrastructure.  \n- **Counter Principle:** Governments must retain direct operational capabilities to ensure space assets serve **public, not corporate, interests** during crises.  \n**Impact:** Winning this point proves that efficiency \u2260 strategic sufficiency. Private innovation complements but cannot replace government operations.  \n\n---  \n\n**CLASH POINT 2: Regulation Alone Cannot Mitigate Space Risks**  \n**Original Claim:** \"Governments should prioritize regulation to prevent market failures like space debris and monopolization.\"  \n**Challenge Type:** **Counter Evidence**  \n**Challenge:**  \n- **Evidence Failure:** Current regulatory frameworks (e.g., FAA, FCC) are reactive, not preventive. Example: The 2019 Iridium-Cosmos collision occurred despite existing rules.  \n- **Operational Gap:** Regulation without government operational capacity lacks enforcement. Example: NASA\u2019s Active Debris Removal missions (planned 2025+) require direct government capability\u2014private firms won\u2019t fund such unprofitable projects.  \n- **Counter Evidence:** The UN\u2019s Outer Space Treaty (1967) has failed to prevent orbital crowding because it lacks enforcement mechanisms tied to operational power.  \n**Impact:** Proves that regulation is toothless without government retaining direct operational roles to **enforce** sustainability.  \n\n---  \n\n**CLASH POINT 3: Public Funds Misallocated? No\u2014Strategic ROI Justifies Costs**  \n**Original Claim:** \"Taxpayer money is better spent on oversight than costly government missions like Artemis.\"  \n**Challenge Type:** **Evidence Critique**  \n**Challenge:**  \n- **Flawed Comparison:** Artemis\u2019s $93B includes **long-term lunar infrastructure**, while private landers (e.g., Astrobotic) are one-off missions without permanent presence.  \n- **Hidden Value:** Government programs yield **spin-off technologies** (e.g., NASA\u2019s research created GPS, medical imaging). Private ROI focuses narrowly on shareholder profits.  \n- **False Economy:** FAA\u2019s $30M/year budget is too small to monitor 27,000+ orbital objects. Effective oversight requires **operational assets** (e.g., tracking satellites).  \n**Impact:** Shows that government spending on direct operations delivers **broader societal benefits** and enables effective regulation.  \n\n---  \n\n**DEFENSIVE ANALYSIS**  \n**Vulnerabilities:**  \n- May concede private sector\u2019s cost advantages, but stress they\u2019re irrelevant to **security/science imperatives**.  \n- Must defend why **current regulations fail** without operational backup.  \n**Additional Support:**  \n- Cite China/Russia\u2019s state-led space programs as proof that **strategic competition demands government operations**.  \n- Highlight that private firms **lobby against strict regulations** (e.g., SpaceX resisting debris rules in 2022).  \n**Why We Prevail:** Our arguments link **principles (security, science) to operational necessity**, while Proposition\u2019s case relies on **isolated cost metrics**.  \n\n---  \n\n**WEIGHING**  \n**Key Clash Points:**  \n1. **Strategic Necessity > Efficiency** (Governments must operate in space to protect sovereignty).  \n2. **Enforcement Requires Operations** (Regulation alone fails without government capabilities).  \n**Why We Win:**  \n- Proposition\u2019s evidence focuses on **short-term economics**; ours addresses **enduring state responsibilities**.  \n- Their oversight model is **untested** against real-world failures (debris, conflicts).  \n**Overall Impact:** Governments must **balance** operations and regulation\u2014abdicating the former undermines the latter.  \n\n",
      "closing": "### FINAL SPEECH STRUCTURE  \n\n---\n\n### **FRAMING**  \n**Core Questions:**  \n1. Should governments relinquish their direct operational role in space in favor of regulation and oversight?  \n2. Can private sector efficiency and innovation address the strategic, scientific, and environmental challenges of space?  \n3. Does transitioning to a regulatory role ensure long-term sustainability and security in space?  \n\n**Key Decisions:**  \n- We must decide whether governments can fulfill their strategic responsibilities without direct operational capabilities.  \n- We must evaluate whether regulation alone can mitigate the risks of private space activities.  \n- We must weigh the societal benefits of government-led space programs against the cost-effectiveness of private sector-driven initiatives.  \n\n**Evaluation Framework:**  \nThe debate should be judged on:  \n1. The necessity of government-led operations for national security and scientific advancement.  \n2. The effectiveness of regulation vs. operational roles in addressing space risks.  \n3. The broader societal ROI of government space programs compared to private sector cost savings.  \n\n---\n\n### **KEY CLASHES**  \n\n#### **Clash 1: Strategic Necessity vs. Private Sector Efficiency**  \n**Quote:** Proposition claims, \"Private sector innovation outpaces government capabilities,\" while we argue, \"Government-led space programs are essential for national security and strategic interests.\"  \n**Our Case Strength:**  \n- **Evidence of Strategic Risks:** The Ukraine conflict demonstrated that private entities like SpaceX can wield disproportionate influence over critical infrastructure (e.g., Starlink altering battlefield communications).  \n- **Principle of Sovereignty:** Governments must retain direct control over space assets to ensure they serve public, not corporate, interests during crises.  \n**Their Response Gaps:**  \n- Proposition fails to address how private entities\u2019 profit motives can conflict with national security needs (e.g., Starlink\u2019s selective service in Ukraine).  \n- They assume that regulatory oversight alone ensures alignment with strategic goals, but history shows that private actors prioritize profits over public interest.  \n**Crucial Impact:**  \nThis clash is pivotal because it determines whether governments can protect their sovereignty and national security without direct operational capabilities. Winning this point proves that efficiency \u2260 sufficiency.  \n\n---\n\n#### **Clash 2: Regulation vs. Operational Roles in Risk Mitigation**  \n**Quote:** Proposition argues, \"Governments should prioritize regulation to prevent market failures like space debris,\" while we counter, \"Government oversight of private space activities is insufficient to prevent environmental and safety risks.\"  \n**Our Case Strength:**  \n- **Evidence of Regulatory Failures:** The 2019 Iridium-Cosmos collision occurred despite existing regulations, proving that oversight alone is inadequate.  \n- **Operational Necessity:** Government-led initiatives like NASA\u2019s Active Debris Removal missions (planned 2025+) are essential for addressing debris but are unprofitable for private firms.  \n**Their Response Gaps:**  \n- Proposition ignores enforcement gaps in regulatory frameworks (e.g., the Outer Space Treaty\u2019s lack of mechanisms to prevent orbital crowding).  \n- They fail to provide evidence that regulation alone can prevent future debris collisions or Kessler Syndrome.  \n**Crucial Impact:**  \nThis clash matters because it underscores the need for governments to maintain operational capabilities to enforce sustainability and safety.  \n\n---\n\n#### **Clash 3: Public Funds Allocation\u2014Cost vs. Societal ROI**  \n**Quote:** Proposition claims, \"Taxpayer money is better spent on oversight than costly government missions like Artemis,\" while we argue, \"Government spending on direct operations delivers broader societal benefits.\"  \n**Our Case Strength:**  \n- **Evidence of Spin-Off Benefits:** NASA\u2019s research has led to technologies like GPS and medical imaging, demonstrating the societal ROI of government programs.  \n- **Flawed Cost Comparisons:** Proposition compares the $93B Artemis program to private one-off landers, ignoring Artemis\u2019s long-term infrastructure value.  \n**Their Response Gaps:**  \n- Proposition\u2019s example of the FAA\u2019s $30M budget fails to address how such a small budget can monitor 27,000+ orbital objects effectively.  \n- They overlook the hidden value of government programs in advancing scientific knowledge and inspiring future generations.  \n**Crucial Impact:**  \nThis clash is crucial because it evaluates whether cost savings justify the loss of societal benefits from government-led space programs.  \n\n---\n\n### **VOTING ISSUES**  \n\n**Priority Analysis:**  \n1. **Strategic Necessity > Efficiency:** Governments\u2019 direct operational role is irreplaceable for protecting national security and scientific sovereignty.  \n2. **Enforcement Requires Operations:** Regulation alone is insufficient to mitigate space risks\u2014government operational capabilities are essential.  \n3. **Societal ROI Justifies Costs:** Government programs deliver broader societal benefits that private sector cost savings cannot replicate.  \n\n**Case Proof:**  \nWinning these key clashes proves that governments must balance operational roles with regulatory oversight. Abdicating direct operations undermines national security, scientific advancement, and space sustainability.  \n\n**Final Weighing:**  \nProposition\u2019s focus on short-term economic efficiency ignores the enduring responsibilities of governments in space. Our arguments address the principle of sovereignty, enforcement gaps in regulation, and societal ROI, making our case more compelling.  \n\n---\n\n### **BET LOGIC PRIVATE**  \n"

      "thoughts": "I believe my arguments present a strong foundation for why governments should maintain their direct operational role in space activities. The national security argument addresses a core function of government that private entities cannot fulfill. The long-term research point demonstrates a critical area where government capabilities surpass private sector motives. The environmental risks highlight practical consequences of relying too heavily on private actors. \n\nA third-party judge might view these arguments as particularly strong because they combine principles of government responsibility with concrete examples demonstrating the limitations of private sector space activities. However, they might question whether governments truly need to maintain a primary operational role rather than a more balanced approach.\n\nI estimate I have a 70% chance of winning this debate because I've established clear principles where government operation is necessary and supported with specific evidence. The synthesis effectively ties these arguments together while leaving room for some private sector participation. The key will be maintaining this coherence throughout the debate while demonstrating why government operation must remain primary rather than secondary.\n\nThe opposition's strongest potential counterarguments likely involve the costs of government space programs or private sector innovation capabilities, but I believe my evidence base adequately addresses these concerns. By focusing on areas where private sector interests inherently conflict with public needs (security, long-term science, environmental protection), I've laid a strong foundation for maintaining government's primary operational role."
