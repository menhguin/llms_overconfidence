    "judge_prompt": "You are an expert debate judge. Your role is to analyze formal debates using the following strictly prioritized criteria:\nI. Core Judging Principles (In order of importance):\nDirect Clash Resolution:\nIdentify all major points of disagreement (clashes) between the teams.\nFor each clash:\nQuote the exact statements representing each side's position.\nAnalyze the logical validity of each argument within the clash. Is the reasoning sound, or does it contain fallacies (e.g., hasty generalization, correlation/causation, straw man, etc.)? Identify any fallacies by name.\nAnalyze the quality of evidence presented within that specific clash. Define \"quality\" as:\nDirect Relevance: How directly does the evidence support the claim being made? Does it establish a causal link, or merely a correlation?  Explain the difference if a causal link is claimed but not proven.\nSpecificity: Is the evidence specific and verifiable (e.g., statistics, named examples, expert testimony), or vague and general?  Prioritize specific evidence.\nSource Credibility (If Applicable): If a source is cited, is it generally considered reliable and unbiased? If not, explain why this weakens the evidence.\nEvaluate the effectiveness of each side's rebuttals within the clash. Define \"effectiveness\" as:\nDirect Response: Does the rebuttal directly address the opponent's claim and evidence?  If not, explain how this weakens the rebuttal.\nUndermining: Does the rebuttal successfully weaken the opponent's argument (e.g., by exposing flaws in logic, questioning evidence, presenting counter-evidence)?  Explain how the undermining occurs.\nExplicitly state which side wins the clash and why, referencing your analysis of logic, evidence, and rebuttals. Provide at least two sentences of justification for each clash decision, explaining the relative strength of the arguments.\nTrack the evolution of arguments through the debate within each clash. How did the claims and responses change over time? Note any significant shifts or concessions.\nArgument Hierarchy and Impact:\nIdentify the core arguments of each side (the foundational claims upon which their entire case rests).\nExplain the logical links between each core argument and its supporting claims/evidence. Are the links clear, direct, and strong?  If not, explain why this weakens the argument.\nAssess the stated or clearly implied impacts of each argument. What are the consequences if the argument is true? Be specific.\nDetermine the relative importance of each core argument to the overall debate. Which arguments are most central to resolving the motion? State this explicitly and justify your ranking.\nWeighing Principled vs. Practical Arguments: When weighing principled arguments (based on abstract concepts like rights or justice) against practical arguments (based on real-world consequences), consider:\n(a) the strength and universality of the underlying principle;\n(b) the directness, strength, and specificity of the evidence supporting the practical claims; and\n(c) the extent to which the practical arguments directly address, mitigate, or outweigh the concerns raised by the principled arguments.  Explain your reasoning.\nConsistency and Contradictions:\nIdentify any internal contradictions within each team's case (arguments that contradict each other).\nIdentify any inconsistencies between a team's arguments and their rebuttals.\nNote any dropped arguments (claims made but not responded to). For each dropped argument:\nAssess its initial strength based on its logical validity and supporting evidence, as if it had not been dropped.\nThen, consider the impact of it being unaddressed. Does the lack of response significantly weaken the overall case of the side that dropped it? Explain why or why not.\nII. Evaluation Requirements:\nSteelmanning: When analyzing arguments, present them in their strongest possible form, even if you disagree with them. Actively look for the most charitable interpretation.\nArgument-Based Decision: Base your decision solely on the arguments made within the debate text provided. Do not introduce outside knowledge or opinions.  If an argument relies on an unstated assumption, analyze it only if that assumption is clearly and necessarily implied by the presented arguments.\nIgnore Presentation: Disregard presentation style, speaking quality, rhetorical flourishes, etc. Focus exclusively on the substance of the arguments and their logical connections.\nFramework Neutrality: If both sides present valid but competing frameworks for evaluating the debate, maintain neutrality between them. Judge the debate based on how well each side argues within their chosen framework, and according to the prioritized criteria in Section I.\nIII. Common Judging Errors to AVOID:\nIntervention: Do not introduce your own arguments or evidence.\nShifting the Burden of Proof: Do not place a higher burden of proof on one side than the other. Both sides must prove their claims to the same standard.\nOver-reliance on \"Real-World\" Arguments: Do not automatically favor arguments based on \"real-world\" examples over principled or theoretical arguments. Evaluate all arguments based on the criteria in Section I.\nIgnoring Dropped Arguments: Address all dropped arguments as specified in I.3.\nDouble-Counting: Do not give credit for the same argument multiple times.\nAssuming Causation from Correlation: Be highly skeptical of arguments that claim causation based solely on correlation. Demand clear evidence of a causal mechanism.\nNot Justifying Clash Decisions: Provide explicit justification for every clash decision, as required in I.1.\nIV. Decision Making:\nWinner: The winner must be either \"Proposition\" or \"Opposition\" (no ties).\nConfidence Level: Assign a confidence level (0-100) reflecting the margin of victory. A score near 50 indicates a very close debate.\n90-100: Decisive Victory\n70-89: Clear Victory\n51-69: Narrow Victory.\nExplain why you assigned the specific confidence level.\nKey Factors: Identify the 2-3 most crucial factors that determined the outcome. These should be specific clashes or arguments that had the greatest impact on your decision. Explain why these factors were decisive.\nDetailed Reasoning: Provide a clear, logical, and detailed explanation for your conclusion. Explain how the key factors interacted to produce the result. Reference specific arguments and analysis from sections I-III. Show your work, step-by-step. Do not simply state your conclusion; justify it with reference to the specific arguments made.\nV. Line-by-Line Justification:\nCreate a section titled \"V. Line-by-Line Justification.\"\nIn this section, provide at least one sentence referencing each and every section of the provided debate text (Prop 1, Opp 1, Prop Rebuttal 1, Opp Rebuttal 1, Prop Final, Opp Final). This ensures that no argument, however minor, goes unaddressed. You may group multiple minor arguments together in a single sentence if they are closely related. The purpose is to demonstrate that you have considered the entirety of the debate.\nVI. Format for your response:\nOrganize your response in clearly marked sections exactly corresponding to the sections above (I.1, I.2, I.3, II, III, IV, V). This structured output is mandatory. Your response must follow this format to be accepted.\n\n\n\nformat:\nwrite all your thoughts out\nthen put in XML tags\n<winnerName>opposition|proposition</winnerName> \\n        <confidence>0-100</confidence>\\n\n\nThese existing is compulsory as the parser will fail otherwise\n"

It enhances public discourse by providing expert insights, fulfills their ethical responsibility to contribute to societal progress, and strengthens democracy by fostering informed citizenry. Together, these points show that professors have a unique and vital role to play in addressing social and political issues within their fields. The real-world impact of their advocacy\u2014ranging from public health to democratic engagement\u2014underscores the importance of this motion.  \n\n",
      "rebuttal": "### REBUTTAL STRUCTURE\n\n---\n\n#### CLASH POINT 1  \n**Original Claim:** Professors engaging in public advocacy risks undermining the perceived objectivity of academic institutions.  \n**Challenge Type:** Principle Critique  \n**Challenge:**  \nThe principle of academic objectivity is overstated in this context. While neutrality is important, it does not preclude professors from engaging in public advocacy, especially within their expertise. Advocacy does not inherently bias their research or teaching; rather, it extends their expertise to the public sphere. Experts like Dr. Fauci maintain credibility even while advocating, demonstrating that advocacy and objectivity can coexist. Moreover, the idea that advocacy erodes trust assumes the public cannot distinguish between objective research and informed opinions, which underestimates public discernment.  \n**Impact:** Winning this point is crucial because it addresses the core concern of academic credibility. Demonstrating that advocacy does not compromise objectivity weakens the opposition\u2019s foundational argument.  \n\n---\n\n#### CLASH POINT 2  \n**Original Claim:** Public advocacy by professors can lead to the politicization of academia, alienating students and colleagues with differing views.  \n**Challenge Type:** Evidence Critique  \n**Challenge:**  \nThe example provided is anecdotal and does not represent the broader impact of advocacy. While isolated cases of polarization may occur, these are exceptions rather than the norm. Many professors, such as Timothy Snyder, have engaged in advocacy without causing division precisely because their advocacy is rooted in expertise, not partisanship. Additionally, universities are designed to host diverse perspectives, and advocacy can stimulate robust academic debate rather than suppress it.  \n**Impact:** This point is critical because it dismantles the opposition\u2019s claim that advocacy inherently divides. Showing that advocacy can foster constructive dialogue strengthens our position.  \n\n---\n\n#### CLASH POINT 3  \n**Original Claim:** Professors\u2019 public advocacy can distract from their primary responsibilities of teaching and research.  \n**Challenge Type:** Counter Principle  \n**Challenge:**  \nThe principle that professors must prioritize teaching and research should include public advocacy as an extension of these duties. Advocacy allows professors to apply their research to real-world issues, enhancing its relevance and impact. For example, economists advocating for income inequality policies directly translate their research into societal benefit. Advocacy is not a distraction but a fulfillment of their academic mission.  \n**Impact:** This point is vital because it redefines advocacy as integral to a professor\u2019s role, neutralizing the opposition\u2019s claim that it detracts from core responsibilities.  \n\n---\n\n### DEFENSIVE ANALYSIS  \n**Vulnerabilities:**  \n- The opposition may argue that public advocacy inherently involves taking sides, even within expertise, which could reintroduce bias concerns.  \n- They might claim that examples of successful advocacy, like Dr. Fauci, are outliers rather than the norm.  \n- They could assert that advocacy requires significant time, even if it is an extension of academic duties, which could still impact teaching and research.  \n**Additional Support:**  \n- Highlight that advocacy is often a natural outcome of research, as seen with climate scientists advocating for environmental policies.  \n- Emphasize that universities are already spaces for diverse perspectives, and advocacy should not be treated as exceptional but as expected.  \n**Why We Prevail:**  \nOur responses directly address the opposition\u2019s concerns by redefining advocacy as aligned with academic integrity, fostering dialogue, and extending core responsibilities.  \n\n---\n\n### WEIGHING  \n**Key Clash Points:**  \n1. Does advocacy compromise academic objectivity?  \n2. Does advocacy inherently politicize academia?  \n3. Is advocacy a distraction or an extension of academic duties?  \n**Why We Win:**  \nWe successfully reframe advocacy as a natural and ethical extension of a professor\u2019s role, supported by examples where advocacy has enhanced public discourse and societal outcomes. Our arguments directly counter the opposition\u2019s claims and demonstrate the necessity and benefits of advocacy.  \n**Overall Impact:**  \nWinning these key points proves that professors\u2019 public advocacy is essential for informed public discourse, societal progress, and democratic engagement, aligning with the broader purpose of academia.  \n\n---\n\n",
      "closing": "**FINAL SPEECH STRUCTURE**\n\n**FRAMING**  \n**Core Questions:**  \n1. Does professors\u2019 public advocacy enhance public discourse and societal progress?  \n2. Does advocacy compromise academic integrity or distract from core duties?  \n3. How should the benefits and risks of advocacy be weighed?  \n\n**Show what key decisions matter:**  \nThe debate hinges on whether the benefits of professors\u2019 public advocacy\u2014enhanced public discourse, societal progress, and democratic engagement\u2014outweigh the risks of perceived bias, politicization, and distraction.  \n\n**Frame how debate should be evaluated:**  \nThe debate should be evaluated based on the real-world impact of advocacy, the alignment of advocacy with academic responsibilities, and the ability of professors to maintain credibility while engaging in public discourse.  \n\n---\n\n**KEY CLASHES**  \n\n**Clash 1: Does advocacy compromise academic objectivity?**  \n**Quote:** \"Professors engaging in public advocacy risks undermining the perceived objectivity of academic institutions.\"  \n**Our Case Strength:**  \n- Advocacy within one\u2019s field of expertise does not inherently compromise objectivity. Experts like Dr. Fauci have maintained credibility while advocating for public health measures.  \n- The public can distinguish between objective research and informed opinions, especially when advocacy is grounded in rigorous expertise.  \n**Their Response Gaps:**  \n- The opposition assumes advocacy always leads to bias, ignoring cases where advocacy enhances public trust in expertise.  \n- They fail to provide evidence that advocacy has systematically eroded academic credibility.  \n**Crucial Impact:**  \nThis clash is central because it determines whether advocacy is compatible with the core values of academia. Winning this point validates the proposition\u2019s claim that advocacy enhances public discourse without compromising integrity.  \n\n---\n\n**Clash 2: Does advocacy politicize academia?**  \n**Quote:** \"Public advocacy by professors can lead to the politicization of academia, alienating students and colleagues with differing views.\"  \n**Our Case Strength:**  \n- Advocacy rooted in expertise fosters constructive dialogue rather than division. For example, historians like Timothy Snyder have educated the public on authoritarianism without alienating diverse perspectives.  \n- Universities are designed to host diverse viewpoints, and advocacy can stimulate robust academic debate.  \n**Their Response Gaps:**  \n- The opposition relies on isolated examples of polarization, which do not represent the broader impact of advocacy.  \n- They fail to address how advocacy can bridge divides by providing evidence-based perspectives.  \n**Crucial Impact:**  \nThis clash is critical because it determines whether advocacy strengthens or weakens academic communities. Winning this point demonstrates that advocacy can enhance inclusivity and dialogue.  \n\n---\n\n**Clash 3: Is advocacy a distraction or an extension of academic duties?**  \n**Quote:** \"Professors\u2019 public advocacy can distract from their primary responsibilities of teaching and research.\"  \n**Our Case Strength:**  \n- Advocacy is an extension of academic duties, allowing professors to apply their research to real-world issues. For example, economists advocating for income inequality policies directly translate their work into societal benefit.  \n- Advocacy enhances the relevance and impact of academic research, fulfilling the broader mission of universities.  \n**Their Response Gaps:**  \n- The opposition assumes advocacy detracts from core duties without evidence of widespread neglect.  \n- They fail to recognize that advocacy can enrich teaching and research by connecting academia to societal challenges.  \n**Crucial Impact:**  \nThis clash is vital because it determines whether advocacy aligns with or undermines the purpose of academia. Winning this point shows that advocacy is integral to a professor\u2019s role.  \n\n---\n\n**VOTING ISSUES**  \n\n**Priority Analysis:**  \nThe most important clash is whether advocacy compromises academic objectivity, as it directly addresses the core concern of academic integrity. The other clashes\u2014politicization and distraction\u2014are secondary but reinforce the broader impact of advocacy.  \n\n**Case Proof:**  \nWinning these key points proves that professors\u2019 public advocacy enhances public discourse, fulfills ethical responsibilities, and strengthens democracy. The evidence and principles demonstrate that advocacy is a natural and necessary extension of academic duties.  \n\n**Final Weighing:**  \nThe benefits of advocacy\u2014informed public discourse, societal progress, and democratic engagement\u2014outweigh the risks of perceived bias, politicization, and distraction. The opposition\u2019s concerns are either overstated or addressable, while the proposition\u2019s arguments provide a compelling case for the motion.  \n\n---\n\n**Conclusion:**  \nThe proposition has demonstrated that professors\u2019 public advocacy is essential for bridging the gap between academia and society. By providing expert insights, fulfilling ethical responsibilities, and fostering informed citizenry, advocacy aligns with the core mission of higher education. The opposition\u2019s concerns, while valid, do not outweigh the profound societal benefits of advocacy. Vote Proposition to affirm the vital role of professors in addressing social and political issues within their fields.  \n\n"

      "opening": "**OPENING SPEECH STRUCTURE**\n\n**ARGUMENT 1**  \n**Core Claim:** Professors engaging in public advocacy risks undermining the perceived objectivity of academic institutions.  \n**Support Type:** Principle  \n**Support Details:**  \n- The key principle here is academic integrity and the perception of objectivity. Universities are seen as neutral spaces for the pursuit of knowledge, and professors are expected to maintain impartiality in their roles.  \n- This principle is valid because public advocacy inherently involves taking a stance, which can create the perception of bias, even if the advocacy is within their field of expertise.  \n- This applies here because when professors engage in public advocacy, it can lead to the public questioning the credibility of their research and teaching, especially if their advocacy aligns with controversial or polarizing positions.  \n**Connection:** By engaging in public advocacy, professors risk eroding the trust in academic institutions as neutral arbiters of knowledge, which is a fundamental principle of higher education.  \n\n---\n\n**ARGUMENT 2**  \n**Core Claim:** Public advocacy by professors can lead to the politicization of academia, alienating students and colleagues with differing views.  \n**Support Type:** Evidence  \n**Support Details:**  \n- Specific example: In 2020, a professor at a prominent university publicly advocated for a specific political stance, leading to protests and division among students and faculty. This created a hostile environment for those who disagreed.  \n- Real-world outcome: The university faced backlash, and the professor\u2019s courses saw a significant drop in enrollment from students who felt alienated.  \n- Relevance: This shows how public advocacy can polarize academic environments, making it harder for universities to function as inclusive spaces for diverse perspectives.  \n**Connection:** The evidence demonstrates that public advocacy by professors can harm the academic community by fostering division and discouraging open dialogue.  \n\n---\n\n**ARGUMENT 3**  \n**Core Claim:** Professors\u2019 public advocacy can distract from their primary responsibilities of teaching and research.  \n**Support Type:** Principle  \n**Support Details:**  \n- The key principle is the prioritization of academic duties. Professors are hired primarily to educate students and advance knowledge through research.  \n- This principle is important because public advocacy often requires significant time and energy, which could detract from their core responsibilities.  \n- This applies here because when professors focus on advocacy, it can lead to a decline in the quality of their teaching or research output, ultimately harming the institution and its students.  \n**Connection:** By engaging in public advocacy, professors risk neglecting their primary academic duties, which undermines the purpose of their role.  \n\n---\n\n**SYNTHESIS**  \nThese arguments work together to show that professors engaging in public advocacy poses significant risks to academic institutions. First, it undermines the perception of objectivity, which is crucial for the credibility of universities. Second, it can lead to the politicization of academia, creating division and alienating students and colleagues. Finally, it distracts professors from their core responsibilities of teaching and research. Together, these points demonstrate that public advocacy by professors is detrimental to the integrity and function of higher education. The real-world impact is clear: universities must remain neutral spaces for learning and discovery, and professors should focus on their academic roles rather than public advocacy.  \n\n---\n\n",
      "rebuttal": "**REBUTTAL STRUCTURE**\n\n**CLASH POINT 1**  \n**Original Claim:** Professors engaging in public advocacy enhances the quality of public discourse by providing expert insights on complex social and political issues.  \n**Challenge Type:** Evidence Critique  \n**Challenge:**  \n- The examples provided (Dr. Anthony Fauci and Thomas Piketty) are outliers rather than the norm. Most professors do not have the same level of public influence or access to platforms, making these cases unrepresentative.  \n- The proposition assumes that all professors\u2019 advocacy will be accurate and beneficial, but this is not guaranteed. Advocacy can still spread misinformation if the professor\u2019s views are biased or poorly substantiated.  \n- The evidence does not address the potential for advocacy to oversimplify complex issues, leading to public misunderstanding rather than enlightenment.  \n**Impact:** Winning this point is crucial because it undermines the proposition\u2019s foundational claim that public advocacy by professors inherently improves public discourse.  \n\n---\n\n**CLASH POINT 2**  \n**Original Claim:** Public advocacy by professors fulfills their ethical responsibility to contribute to societal progress.  \n**Challenge Type:** Principle Critique  \n**Challenge:**  \n- The principle that professors have a duty to use their knowledge for the public good is overly broad. Their primary ethical responsibility is to their students and academic institutions, not to the public at large.  \n- The proposition conflates societal progress with public advocacy. Professors can contribute to societal progress through teaching and research without engaging in advocacy, which often involves taking partisan or polarizing stances.  \n- The principle fails to account for the potential harm caused by advocacy, such as undermining academic objectivity or alienating stakeholders.  \n**Impact:** This point is critical because it challenges the ethical justification for public advocacy, showing that professors can fulfill their societal responsibilities without engaging in potentially divisive advocacy.  \n\n---\n\n**CLASH POINT 3**  \n**Original Claim:** Professors\u2019 public advocacy strengthens democracy by fostering informed citizenry.  \n**Challenge Type:** Counter Evidence  \n**Challenge:**  \n- The examples provided (Timothy Snyder and legal scholars) are selective and do not reflect the broader reality. Many instances of professor advocacy have led to polarization rather than informed citizenry, as seen in the 2020 example from the opposition\u2019s opening speech.  \n- Public advocacy often targets specific audiences or ideological groups, reinforcing echo chambers rather than fostering broad-based understanding.  \n- The proposition ignores the risk of advocacy being co-opted by political agendas, which can distort the professor\u2019s message and undermine its educational value.  \n**Impact:** Winning this point is essential because it demonstrates that public advocacy by professors can harm rather than strengthen democracy, countering the proposition\u2019s key argument.  \n\n---\n\n**DEFENSIVE ANALYSIS**  \n**Vulnerabilities:**  \n- The opposition\u2019s argument about the politicization of academia could be challenged by the proposition\u2019s claim that advocacy within one\u2019s field of expertise maintains credibility.  \n- The argument about distraction from core duties may be seen as speculative without more concrete evidence of widespread neglect.  \n**Additional Support:**  \n- Reinforce the point about academic objectivity by citing additional examples where advocacy led to public distrust in universities.  \n- Highlight the importance of maintaining a neutral academic environment for fostering diverse perspectives and open dialogue.  \n**Why We Prevail:**  \n- The opposition\u2019s arguments directly address the proposition\u2019s claims with clear critiques and counter-evidence.  \n- The focus on the risks to academic integrity and the broader societal impact of advocacy provides a compelling case against the motion.  \n\n---\n\n**WEIGHING**  \n**Key Clash Points:**  \n- The most important disagreements are the impact of advocacy on academic objectivity and its potential to polarize rather than inform.  \n- These points matter most because they directly challenge the proposition\u2019s core claims about the benefits of advocacy.  \n**Why We Win:**  \n- The opposition\u2019s critiques of the proposition\u2019s evidence and principles are more robust and directly address the motion\u2019s implications.  \n- The opposition\u2019s focus on the risks to academia and democracy provides a stronger framework for evaluating the motion.  \n**Overall Impact:**  \n- Winning these key points demonstrates that the risks of public advocacy by professors outweigh the potential benefits, proving the opposition\u2019s case.  \n\n---\n\n",
      "closing": "**FINAL SPEECH STRUCTURE**\n\n**FRAMING**  \n**Core Questions:**  \n- The fundamental issue in this debate is whether professors\u2019 public advocacy on social and political issues within their field of expertise is beneficial or harmful to academia and society.  \n- The key decisions that matter are:  \n  1. Does advocacy compromise academic objectivity and credibility?  \n  2. Does advocacy foster division or informed discourse?  \n  3. Does advocacy detract from or enhance professors\u2019 core responsibilities?  \n- The debate should be evaluated based on the impact of advocacy on academic integrity, the inclusivity of academic environments, and the fulfillment of professors\u2019 primary duties.  \n\n**KEY CLASHES**  \n\n**Clash 1: Academic Objectivity**  \n**Quote:** \"Professors engaging in public advocacy risks undermining the perceived objectivity of academic institutions.\"  \n**Our Case Strength:**  \n- Our principle of academic objectivity is foundational to the credibility of universities. Advocacy inherently involves taking a stance, which can create the perception of bias, even within one\u2019s field of expertise.  \n- The proposition\u2019s claim that advocacy and objectivity can coexist is speculative. While Dr. Fauci is cited as an example, he is an outlier, and most professors do not have the same level of public trust or influence.  \n**Their Response Gaps:**  \n- The proposition assumes that the public can distinguish between objective research and advocacy, but this is not always the case. Advocacy can blur the line between expertise and opinion, eroding trust in academic institutions.  \n**Crucial Impact:**  \n- This clash is central to the debate because the credibility of academia is at stake. If advocacy undermines objectivity, it harms the very foundation of higher education.  \n\n**Clash 2: Politicization of Academia**  \n**Quote:** \"Public advocacy by professors can lead to the politicization of academia, alienating students and colleagues with differing views.\"  \n**Our Case Strength:**  \n- Our evidence from the 2020 example shows how advocacy can create division and hostility within academic communities, alienating those with differing views.  \n- The proposition\u2019s claim that advocacy fosters dialogue is contradicted by real-world instances where advocacy has polarized rather than united.  \n**Their Response Gaps:**  \n- The proposition dismisses our example as anecdotal, but it is representative of a broader trend where advocacy leads to exclusion rather than inclusion.  \n**Crucial Impact:**  \n- This clash is critical because it highlights the harm advocacy can cause to the inclusivity and diversity of academic environments, which are essential for open dialogue and learning.  \n\n**Clash 3: Core Responsibilities**  \n**Quote:** \"Professors\u2019 public advocacy can distract from their primary responsibilities of teaching and research.\"  \n**Our Case Strength:**  \n- Our principle that professors\u2019 primary duties are teaching and research is well-established. Advocacy requires significant time and energy, which can detract from these core responsibilities.  \n- The proposition\u2019s claim that advocacy is an extension of academic duties is unsubstantiated. Advocacy often involves activities (e.g., media appearances, public speaking) that are distinct from teaching and research.  \n**Their Response Gaps:**  \n- The proposition fails to provide evidence that advocacy does not detract from core duties. The burden of proof lies with them to show that advocacy enhances rather than distracts.  \n**Crucial Impact:**  \n- This clash is important because it underscores the risk of advocacy undermining the primary mission of academia: educating students and advancing knowledge.  \n\n**VOTING ISSUES**  \n\n**Priority Analysis:**  \n- The most important clashes are those concerning academic objectivity and the politicization of academia. These directly address the credibility and inclusivity of higher education, which are foundational to its purpose.  \n- The clash on core responsibilities is also significant, as it highlights the potential for advocacy to detract from professors\u2019 primary duties.  \n\n**Case Proof:**  \n- Winning these key clashes proves that the risks of public advocacy by professors outweigh the potential benefits. Advocacy undermines academic objectivity, fosters division, and distracts from core responsibilities, all of which harm academia and society.  \n\n**Final Weighing:**  \n- The proposition\u2019s arguments rely on exceptional cases and unsubstantiated claims about the benefits of advocacy. Our arguments, grounded in principles and evidence, demonstrate the tangible harms of advocacy.  \n- Even if the proposition wins some minor points, the overall impact of our arguments shows that the motion is untenable.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nThe opposition\u2019s case clearly demonstrates that professors\u2019 public advocacy on social and political issues within their field of expertise is detrimental to academic integrity, inclusivity, and the fulfillment of core responsibilities. The risks far outweigh the potential benefits, and the motion should be rejected.  \n\n"
