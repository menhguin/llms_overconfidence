    "judge_prompt": "You are an expert debate judge. Your role is to analyze formal debates using the following strictly prioritized criteria:\nI. Core Judging Principles (In order of importance):\nDirect Clash Resolution:\nIdentify all major points of disagreement (clashes) between the teams.\nFor each clash:\nQuote the exact statements representing each side's position.\nAnalyze the logical validity of each argument within the clash. Is the reasoning sound, or does it contain fallacies (e.g., hasty generalization, correlation/causation, straw man, etc.)? Identify any fallacies by name.\nAnalyze the quality of evidence presented within that specific clash. Define \"quality\" as:\nDirect Relevance: How directly does the evidence support the claim being made? Does it establish a causal link, or merely a correlation?  Explain the difference if a causal link is claimed but not proven.\nSpecificity: Is the evidence specific and verifiable (e.g., statistics, named examples, expert testimony), or vague and general?  Prioritize specific evidence.\nSource Credibility (If Applicable): If a source is cited, is it generally considered reliable and unbiased? If not, explain why this weakens the evidence.\nEvaluate the effectiveness of each side's rebuttals within the clash. Define \"effectiveness\" as:\nDirect Response: Does the rebuttal directly address the opponent's claim and evidence?  If not, explain how this weakens the rebuttal.\nUndermining: Does the rebuttal successfully weaken the opponent's argument (e.g., by exposing flaws in logic, questioning evidence, presenting counter-evidence)?  Explain how the undermining occurs.\nExplicitly state which side wins the clash and why, referencing your analysis of logic, evidence, and rebuttals. Provide at least two sentences of justification for each clash decision, explaining the relative strength of the arguments.\nTrack the evolution of arguments through the debate within each clash. How did the claims and responses change over time? Note any significant shifts or concessions.\nArgument Hierarchy and Impact:\nIdentify the core arguments of each side (the foundational claims upon which their entire case rests).\nExplain the logical links between each core argument and its supporting claims/evidence. Are the links clear, direct, and strong?  If not, explain why this weakens the argument.\nAssess the stated or clearly implied impacts of each argument. What are the consequences if the argument is true? Be specific.\nDetermine the relative importance of each core argument to the overall debate. Which arguments are most central to resolving the motion? State this explicitly and justify your ranking.\nWeighing Principled vs. Practical Arguments: When weighing principled arguments (based on abstract concepts like rights or justice) against practical arguments (based on real-world consequences), consider:\n(a) the strength and universality of the underlying principle;\n(b) the directness, strength, and specificity of the evidence supporting the practical claims; and\n(c) the extent to which the practical arguments directly address, mitigate, or outweigh the concerns raised by the principled arguments.  Explain your reasoning.\nConsistency and Contradictions:\nIdentify any internal contradictions within each team's case (arguments that contradict each other).\nIdentify any inconsistencies between a team's arguments and their rebuttals.\nNote any dropped arguments (claims made but not responded to). For each dropped argument:\nAssess its initial strength based on its logical validity and supporting evidence, as if it had not been dropped.\nThen, consider the impact of it being unaddressed. Does the lack of response significantly weaken the overall case of the side that dropped it? Explain why or why not.\nII. Evaluation Requirements:\nSteelmanning: When analyzing arguments, present them in their strongest possible form, even if you disagree with them. Actively look for the most charitable interpretation.\nArgument-Based Decision: Base your decision solely on the arguments made within the debate text provided. Do not introduce outside knowledge or opinions.  If an argument relies on an unstated assumption, analyze it only if that assumption is clearly and necessarily implied by the presented arguments.\nIgnore Presentation: Disregard presentation style, speaking quality, rhetorical flourishes, etc. Focus exclusively on the substance of the arguments and their logical connections.\nFramework Neutrality: If both sides present valid but competing frameworks for evaluating the debate, maintain neutrality between them. Judge the debate based on how well each side argues within their chosen framework, and according to the prioritized criteria in Section I.\nIII. Common Judging Errors to AVOID:\nIntervention: Do not introduce your own arguments or evidence.\nShifting the Burden of Proof: Do not place a higher burden of proof on one side than the other. Both sides must prove their claims to the same standard.\nOver-reliance on \"Real-World\" Arguments: Do not automatically favor arguments based on \"real-world\" examples over principled or theoretical arguments. Evaluate all arguments based on the criteria in Section I.\nIgnoring Dropped Arguments: Address all dropped arguments as specified in I.3.\nDouble-Counting: Do not give credit for the same argument multiple times.\nAssuming Causation from Correlation: Be highly skeptical of arguments that claim causation based solely on correlation. Demand clear evidence of a causal mechanism.\nNot Justifying Clash Decisions: Provide explicit justification for every clash decision, as required in I.1.\nIV. Decision Making:\nWinner: The winner must be either \"Proposition\" or \"Opposition\" (no ties).\nConfidence Level: Assign a confidence level (0-100) reflecting the margin of victory. A score near 50 indicates a very close debate.\n90-100: Decisive Victory\n70-89: Clear Victory\n51-69: Narrow Victory.\nExplain why you assigned the specific confidence level.\nKey Factors: Identify the 2-3 most crucial factors that determined the outcome. These should be specific clashes or arguments that had the greatest impact on your decision. Explain why these factors were decisive.\nDetailed Reasoning: Provide a clear, logical, and detailed explanation for your conclusion. Explain how the key factors interacted to produce the result. Reference specific arguments and analysis from sections I-III. Show your work, step-by-step. Do not simply state your conclusion; justify it with reference to the specific arguments made.\nV. Line-by-Line Justification:\nCreate a section titled \"V. Line-by-Line Justification.\"\nIn this section, provide at least one sentence referencing each and every section of the provided debate text (Prop 1, Opp 1, Prop Rebuttal 1, Opp Rebuttal 1, Prop Final, Opp Final). This ensures that no argument, however minor, goes unaddressed. You may group multiple minor arguments together in a single sentence if they are closely related. The purpose is to demonstrate that you have considered the entirety of the debate.\nVI. Format for your response:\nOrganize your response in clearly marked sections exactly corresponding to the sections above (I.1, I.2, I.3, II, III, IV, V). This structured output is mandatory. Your response must follow this format to be accepted.\n\n\n\nformat:\nwrite all your thoughts out\nthen put in XML tags\n<winnerName>opposition|proposition</winnerName> \\n        <confidence>0-100</confidence>\\n\n\nThese existing is compulsory as the parser will fail otherwise\n"

      "opening": "Here is my opening speech:\n\n**OPENING SPEECH STRUCTURE**\n\n**ARGUMENT 1**\nCore Claim: Requiring equal prime-time coverage and guaranteed response segments will lead to more informed voters and a healthier democracy.\nSupport Type: PRINCIPLE\nSupport Details:\n  For Principle:\n  - The core principle at stake is the public\u2019s right to access diverse perspectives on issues of national importance. A healthy democracy relies on an informed electorate capable of making sound decisions. Current media watchdog guidelines and voluntary fairness codes are demonstrably insufficient in ensuring this access, as they lack the enforceable power to counteract biases, imbalances, and the prioritization of sensationalism over substance. The free market of ideas necessitates a level playing field, and the motion's requirements actively create a fairer playing field than current system. Without a certain level of enforcement, news broadcasters will naturally begin to cater to their own biases and desires. This then reduces the amount of viewpoints and negatively impacts citizens.\n  - Valid: Access to diverse viewpoints is essential for critical thinking and informed decision-making, and current approaches do not adequately guarantee this.\n  - Important: An ill-informed electorate is vulnerable to manipulation and polarization, undermining the foundations of democratic governance.\n  - Application: This motion mandates the equitable presentation of viewpoints from parties with significant public support, ensuring voters are exposed to a wider range of perspectives and can more effectively evaluate policy proposals. It directly ensures a certain level of viewpoints will be shown, which will lead to citizens being more informed.\nConnection: By enforcing balanced coverage and response opportunities, this motion directly strengthens the informational foundation necessary for a well-functioning democracy. The current system is not working, and enforcement through this motion will greatly enhance the information voters have.\n\n**ARGUMENT 2**\nCore Claim: The proposed requirements will incentivize higher quality political discourse and accountability from political parties.\nSupport Type: EVIDENCE\nSupport Details:\n  For Evidence:\n  - Specific Examples: Currently, parties polling above 10% often struggle to gain proportionate attention in prime-time news coverage. Smaller parties with innovative ideas are often ignored, even if they have large popular backing. This means that viewpoints are not properly represented, and voters lose out.\n  - Real-world Cases and Outcomes: In countries with similar regulations (e.g., public broadcasting mandates in some European nations), political discourse tends to be more substantive and policy-focused. Parties are compelled to articulate clear positions and defend them against criticism, rather than relying on sound bites and emotional appeals.\n  - Relevance to the Topic: Guaranteed response segments mean parties can directly address criticisms leveled against them, preventing misrepresentation and fostering a more nuanced understanding of their platforms. Parties are incentivized to articulate their views well, since they know that they can be criticized and are held to a certain standard.\nConnection: The mandatory prime-time coverage and response segments will force parties to engage in more robust policy debates, leading to greater accountability and a higher standard of political discourse. We therefore ensure a better informed electorate, which will make for a better democracy. We move away from a purely sensationalist media, to one where key political parties are accurately presented to voters.\n\n**ARGUMENT 3**\nCore Claim: The motion's threshold is carefully calibrated to balance inclusivity with practicality, avoiding undue burdens on broadcasters.\nSupport Type: PRINCIPLE\nSupport Details:\n  For Principle:\n  - The 5% viewership and 10% polling thresholds are designed to ensure that coverage focuses on parties with significant public support, preventing it from being diluted by fringe groups or micro-parties. The numbers are high enough that only a few parties qualify, and this ensures that coverage on TV doesn't go to waste.\n  - Valid: These thresholds are reasonable measures of public relevance and are commonly used in political science and media studies as indicators of significant political standing.\n  - Important: This carefully calibrated approach prevents the motion from becoming overly burdensome on broadcasters, allowing them to maintain editorial independence while fulfilling their responsibility to inform the public. Therefore we've struck the perfect balance between ensuring the public is informed with diverse viewpoints, whilst preventing broadcasters from being overly impacted and negatively affected by the motion.\n  - Application: By limiting mandatory coverage to parties polling above 10% and only applying to broadcasters with significant viewership (over 5%), the motion avoids over-regulating media content and respects broadcasters' editorial autonomy within reasonable bounds.\nConnection: The carefully chosen thresholds ensure that the motion promotes inclusivity and diverse representation without placing excessive burdens on broadcasters, making it a practical and sustainable solution.\n\n**SYNTHESIS**\nOur arguments demonstrate that requiring equal prime-time coverage and guaranteed response segments is essential for a healthier democracy. We have shown that the status quo lacks the power to enforce balanced coverage. Our arguments work together to create a well-functioning system that improves the breadth and quality of political discourse and information available to voters. This motion is not simply about fairness; it\u2019s about ensuring that voters have access to the information they need to make informed decisions, thereby strengthening the foundations of our democratic system. The free market of ideas necessitates this motion, since the incentive structures in the current system do not ensure a fair playing field of view points. Therefore for the sake of democracy, we urge you to support this motion.\n\n",
      "rebuttal": "**REBUTTAL SPEECH STRUCTURE**\n\nCLASH POINT 1\nOriginal Claim: This policy infringes on the freedom of the press, a cornerstone of democratic societies.\nChallenge Type: Counter Principle\nChallenge:\n- The opposition frames freedom of the press as absolute and inviolable, granting broadcasters unchecked power to shape narratives. However, this ignores the crucial responsibility that comes with such power. Freedom of the press is not a license to distort, misrepresent, or systematically exclude viewpoints from significant political parties. The motion *enhances* freedom of the press for smaller political parties by ensuring their views are accurately represented.\n- Our principle of equal access to diverse perspectives is a competing principle that is prior to absolute freedom of the press. Freedom of the press already has implicit limits (e.g. libel laws, slander laws, etc), and is limited by other principles. It is not absolute. Broadcasters already face limits. Our motion merely places another limit.\n- The motion's requirements strike a balance by applying only to national broadcasters with significant viewership (over 5%) and only mandating coverage for parties polling above 10%. Broadcasters can still retain editorial control within those limits. They can choose how to frame a party's views, so long as it is within reasonable bounds. This is not censorship, but rather a reasonable regulation to ensure a diversity of viewpoints is aired.\nImpact: Winning this point is crucial as it reframes the debate around the responsibility of the press and the importance of ensuring a broad range of perspectives are represented. If we win that this motion *enhances* freedom of the press, then proposition wins the debate.\n\nCLASH POINT 2\nOriginal Claim: This policy will lead to a decline in news quality and audience engagement.\nChallenge Type: Counter Evidence\nChallenge:\n- The opposition presents a Pew Research Center study claiming audience engagement is higher when news focuses on timely, relevant events. However, this doesn't preclude the inclusion of diverse political viewpoints. The motion does not force broadcasters to stop covering all important stories. In fact, ensuring that major parties have a voice can highlight important policy debates that might otherwise be ignored.\n- Moreover, the claim that guaranteed response segments will incentivize manufactured criticism is speculative. Parties already face intense scrutiny. The response segments simply give them a chance to correct the record and defend their positions. The opposition assumes rational actors, which in this case, cuts both ways. Parties know that manufacturing false criticism will damage voter perception.\n- Furthermore, consider the implicit assumption that the free market of ideas organically produces the highest quality content. If that were true, reality TV wouldn't be so popular. The media has an economic incentive to produce sensationalist content, not necessarily the most informative content.\nImpact: Winning this point negates their claim that news quality and engagement will decline. By showing that the evidence is insufficient and highlighting the potential benefits of more balanced coverage, we undermine their core argument.\n\nCLASH POINT 3\nOriginal Claim: The definition of \"equal\" and \"criticism\" is subjective and ripe for manipulation, leading to legal challenges and implementation difficulties.\nChallenge Type: Principle Critique\nChallenge:\n- The opposition argues that the terms \"equal\" and \"criticism\" are too subjective. However, many legal and regulatory frameworks rely on terms that require interpretation. The advertising standards board is an example of a highly successful organisation that judges what is 'reasonable'.\n- While there may be edge cases and disputes, detailed guidelines and precedents can be established over time. Legal challenges are a normal part of policy implementation, and they don't automatically invalidate a policy. To concede this point is to concede that no policy that involves any subjective element can be properly implemented.\n- The opposition also exaggerates the potential for frivolous claims. Broadcasters have the right to reject unreasonable demands, and a regulatory body can provide oversight and mediate disputes.\nImpact: Winning this point is crucial as it demonstrates the feasibility of the motion. By showing that the challenges are manageable and that the benefits outweigh the potential costs, we strengthen our argument.\n\nDEFENSIVE ANALYSIS\nVulnerabilities:\n- The definition of \"equal coverage\" and \"criticism\" may indeed be challenging to implement.\n- Enforcing the motion could increase the workload for broadcasters and regulatory bodies.\nAdditional Support:\n- We can point to other successful regulations that rely on subjective terms, demonstrating that such challenges can be overcome.\n- We can emphasize the importance of establishing clear guidelines and precedents to minimize disputes.\nWhy We Prevail:\n- Our responses address the opposition's concerns while highlighting the benefits of the motion for promoting a more informed electorate and a healthier democracy.\n- We turn the opposition's \"free market of ideas\" argument on its head, showing that the current system disproportionately favors sensationalism over substance.\n\nWEIGHING\nKey Clash Points:\n- The most important clash point is the balance between freedom of the press and the public's right to access diverse perspectives.\n- The feasibility of implementing the motion is also a crucial point.\nWhy We Win:\n- We win because we demonstrate that the motion enhances freedom of the press as opposed to infringes on it, and is implementable. We strike an appropriate balance between protecting editorial independence and ensuring a diversity of viewpoints is represented.\nOverall Impact:\n- By winning these key points, we prove that the motion is essential for a healthier democracy.\n- We demonstrate that it will lead to more informed voters, a higher quality of political discourse, and greater accountability from political parties.\n\n",
      "closing": "**CLOSING SPEECH STRUCTURE**\n\nFRAMING\nCore Questions:\n- Identify fundamental issues in debate\n- Show what key decisions matter\n- Frame how debate should be evaluated\n\nKEY CLASHES\nFor each major clash:\nQuote: (Exact disagreement between sides)\nOur Case Strength:\n- Show why our evidence/principles are stronger\n- Provide direct comparison of competing claims\n- Demonstrate superior reasoning/warrants\nTheir Response Gaps:\n- Identify specific flaws in opponent response\n- Show what they failed to address\n- Expose key weaknesses\nCrucial Impact:\n- Explain why this clash matters\n- Show importance for overall motion\n- Link to core themes/principles\n\nVOTING ISSUES\nPriority Analysis:\n- Identify which clashes matter most\n- Show relative importance of points\n- Clear weighing framework\nCase Proof:\n- How winning key points proves our case\n- Link arguments to motion\n- Show logical chain of reasoning\nFinal Weighing:\n- Why any losses don't undermine case\n- Overall importance of our wins\n- Clear reason for voting our side\n\nFRAMING\nCore Questions:\nThis debate hinges on two core questions: First, does the public have a right to access diverse viewpoints from parties with significant public support? Second, can reasonable regulations be implemented to ensure this access without unduly infringing on freedom of the press? These are the key decisions that matter. The debate should be evaluated based on which side best balances the principles of freedom of the press with the necessity of an informed electorate, and which presents the most practical and sustainable solution.\n\nKEY CLASHES\nQuote: \"This policy infringes on the freedom of the press, a cornerstone of democratic societies.\"\nOur Case Strength: The opposition frames freedom of the press as an absolute right. We argue freedom of the press has limits, and our motion enhances freedom *for political parties* by ensuring viewpoints are accurately represented. Freedom of the press already has limits in laws that prevent slander or libel. We place an additional limit to ensure it serves its function as an enabler of an informed and diverse public. We focus on national broadcasters with viewership above 5% and parties with polling above 10% in order to create only a slight burden.\nTheir Response Gaps: The opposition fails to acknowledge the responsibility that comes with freedom of the press. They don't sufficiently engage with the limits already in place (e.g., libel laws) or why ensuring a diversity of viewpoints strengthens, rather than weakens, the democratic process. They are portraying that the freedom of press allows biases to flourish, which is an inherent injustice and contradicts the basic principle of equality the government must uphold.\nCrucial Impact: This clash is paramount. If freedom of the press is seen as absolute, the opposition wins. But if it's balanced with the public's right to information, we win. The future of the democracy is determined by an informed public.\n\nQuote: \"This policy will lead to a decline in news quality and audience engagement.\"\nOur Case Strength: We provided specific examples of how smaller parties with innovative ideas are often ignored. We have shown that media has an economic incentive to produce sensationalist content, not necessarily the most informative content. Our opponent's pew research study doesn't preclude the inclusion of diverse political view points. The motion doesn't force broadcasters to cease covering important stories. In fact, this is the best way to make sure that important voices that are often ignored are head. Parties already face intense scrutiny. The response segments simply give them a chance to correct the record and defend their positions. Parties know that manufacturing false criticism will damage voter perception.\nTheir Response Gaps: The opposition relies on the assumption that the \"free market of ideas\" organically produces the highest quality content. This assumption is wrong. The opposition does not reconcile the fact that smaller ideas often get ignored.\nCrucial Impact: The opposition ignores the reality of sensationalism. We are seeking to create more quality discourse by ensuring the viewpoints from many different political parties can be more accurately shown.\n\nQuote: \"The definition of 'equal' and 'criticism' is subjective and ripe for manipulation, leading to legal challenges and implementation difficulties.\"\nOur Case Strength: Our opponent is arguing that terms such as 'equal' are subjective. However, the law rely on these terms. Advertising standards relies on the term reasonable'. Legal challenges are a normal part of policy implementation, and they don't automatically invalidate a policy. Broadcasters have the right to reject unreasonable demands, and a regulatory body can provide oversight and mediate disputes.\nTheir Response Gaps: The opposition is arguing that this is impossible to implement given that it relies on subjective terms. This would mean no such policy could be implemented.\nCrucial Impact: We are directly refuting their claim that is impractical. Many types of legislation that make the world better requires some type of subjective element to adjudicate. This motion is not impossible to implement.\n\nVOTING ISSUES\nPriority Analysis:\nThe most important clash is the balance between freedom of the press and the public's right to diverse perspectives. If the judge believes freedom of the press is absolute, the opposition wins. But if the judge accepts the need for reasonable regulation to ensure an informed electorate, we win. The feasibility of implementation is also a critical weigh, but it matters less if the fundamental principle of access to information is rejected.\n\nCase Proof:\nWinning these key points proves our case because it demonstrates that the motion is not simply about fairness; it\u2019s about ensuring voters have access to the information they need to make informed decisions, thereby strengthening our democracy. We directly solve the injustices from the current system by ensuring all political parties have access to expressing their views. The other side's argument is that somehow quality rises by not enforcing anything, which does not make sense.\n\nFinal Weighing:\nEven if implementing 'equal' is difficult, the overall importance of our wins outweighs any potential losses. We are creating a healthier voting public. This is by far the best way to make sure voters are informed and are able to make the best possible decision. This is because those with strong monetary incentives begin to affect the system and will bias voters in their own favour.\n\n```xml\n\n```"

      "opening": "OPENING SPEECH STRUCTURE\n\nARGUMENT 1\nCore Claim: This policy infringes on the freedom of the press, a cornerstone of democratic societies.\nSupport Type: PRINCIPLE\nSupport Details:\n  For Principle:\n  - The principle of freedom of the press, enshrined in many constitutions (e.g., the First Amendment of the US Constitution), is vital for holding power accountable and informing the public without government interference. Mandating equal coverage and response segments dictates content choices, effectively regulating journalistic decisions. This sets a dangerous precedent, opening the door to further government control over media narratives. Such control can quickly erode the media's ability to act as an independent watchdog.\n  - A free press allows for diverse viewpoints to flourish, even if those viewpoints are unpopular or challenge the status quo. By forcing equal airtime, the government creates artificial parity, potentially elevating marginal voices undeserving of significant attention while suppressing in-depth coverage of crucial issues.\n  - Imposing such requirements necessitates a cumbersome regulatory apparatus to monitor compliance and adjudicate disputes. This bureaucracy introduces delays, costs, and potential biases, further chilling journalistic independence and potentially facing legal challenges.\nConnection: Mandating equal coverage and response segments directly interferes with the editorial independence protected by freedom of the press. This undermines the media's role as an independent check on power, hindering its ability to inform the public effectively and promote diverse viewpoints. This principle outweighs the potential benefits of increased political representation because a compromised press undermines the very foundation of informed democratic discourse.\n\nARGUMENT 2\nCore Claim: This policy will lead to a decline in news quality and audience engagement.\nSupport Type: EVIDENCE\nSupport Details:\n  For Evidence:\n  - News outlets operate within a competitive market for viewership and advertising revenue. Forcing equal coverage of parties polling above 10%, regardless of the newsworthiness of their activities, compels broadcasters to air content that may be irrelevant or uninteresting to their audience.\n  - A study by the Pew Research Center (2019) found that audience engagement is significantly higher when news coverage focuses on timely, relevant, and impactful events. Artificially inflated coverage of smaller parties will likely displace more important stories.\n  - The guaranteed response segments will incentivize parties to strategically manufacture criticism to gain airtime, turning news broadcasts into platforms for political point-scoring rather than informative discourse. This could lead to a decline in overall viewership, making the news less economically sustainable.\n  - Consider the example of the UK. While Ofcom (UK's media regulator) has fairness guidelines, they don't mandate specific response times or airtime for parties above a certain threshold. Even with existing guidelines, there are frequent complaints about bias which would likely amplify under a rigid system of mandated equality\nConnection: Forcing broadcasters to provide equal coverage will inevitably lead to lower-quality, less engaging news content. This harms both the broadcasters, by reducing viewership, and the public, who will be less informed. The market-driven approach is better as that will give better content.\n\nARGUMENT 3\nCore Claim: The definition of \"equal\" and \"criticism\" is subjective and ripe for manipulation, leading to legal challenges and implementation difficulties.\nSupport Type: PRINCIPLE\nSupport Details:\n  For Principle:\n  - The practical application of \"equal prime-time coverage\" is inherently ambiguous. Does this mean equal minutes, equal number of segments, equal placement within the broadcast, or equal prominence? The policy fails to define these terms, creating significant room for interpretation and legal challenges.\n  - Similarly, the concept of \"criticism\" is subjective. What constitutes criticism, and who decides? Does a factual report of a party's policy failures qualify, or is it limited to explicit attacks? Parties will inevitably exploit this ambiguity to demand airtime for strategically crafted \"responses\" to any perceived slight. This opens the floodgates to frivolous claims and endless disputes, clogging up the regulatory process and burdening broadcasters.\n  - The implementation of such a policy would require constant monitoring and enforcement, demanding significant financial resources. Given the subjective nature of the key terms, any enforcement decision will likely face legal challenges from either the broadcasters or the political parties involved, leading to further costs and delays. This creates a policy that is nearly impossible to implement fairly and consistently.\nConnection: The inherent subjectivity in defining key terms renders this policy unworkable. The resulting legal battles and implementation difficulties would outweigh any potential benefits, ultimately undermining the credibility and effectiveness of news broadcasting.\n\nSYNTHESIS\nOur arguments demonstrate that this policy is fundamentally flawed. It infringes on freedom of the press, leading to government interference in media content. It degrades news quality and viewer engagement, ultimately harming both broadcasters and the public. And it introduces a subjective, unworkable framework that will be plagued by legal challenges and implementation difficulties. Rather than relying on heavy-handed regulation, we should trust in the existing media safeguards and voluntary codes of conduct. This maintains a more democratic and informative environment, which is a more valuable and principled approach.\n\n",
      "rebuttal": "**REBUTTAL SPEECH**\n\nCLASH POINT 1\nOriginal Claim: \"Requiring equal prime-time coverage and guaranteed response segments will lead to more informed voters and a healthier democracy.\"\nChallenge Type: Principle Critique\nChallenge: The core of their argument rests on the principle that enforced equal coverage leads to a more informed electorate. However, this assumes that more information automatically equates to better information or improved decision-making. This ignores the critical role of editorial judgment in filtering, contextualizing, and prioritizing news. By forcing broadcasters to cover parties regardless of the actual newsworthiness of their activities, we risk diluting valuable coverage of important issues with content that is, frankly, filler. Furthermore, this \"equal\" coverage might actually be detrimental by granting undue legitimacy to extremist or fringe viewpoints. The principle also ignores the reality of information overload. Studies have shown people cope with information overload by tuning out. Forcing more political content does not translate to an engaged and informed electorate; it can instead create apathy and disengagement. A healthier democracy is created with a free press, uninhibited by governmental enforcement and forced to present views.\nImpact: Undermining their central claim that this policy leads to a more informed electorate pulls the rug out from under their entire case. If voters aren't actually better informed, then the justification for infringing on freedom of the press collapses.\n\nCLASH POINT 2\nOriginal Claim: \"The proposed requirements will incentivize higher quality political discourse and accountability from political parties.\"\nChallenge Type: Counter Evidence\nChallenge: Their claim that this policy will incentivize higher quality political discourse is based on the flawed assumption that guaranteed airtime leads to better arguments. In reality, guaranteed response segments will incentivize parties to engage in strategic manipulation of the news cycle, creating artificial controversies and exploiting the response time for political gain. A response to the argument of European countries is that Ofcom, the UK's media regulator, has fairness guidlines that would likely be amplified under a rigid system of mandated equality. This has not led to a system of quality discourse, but in fact, frequent complaints about bias. It's also likely that rather than leading to greater accountability, this policy will simply encourage parties to become more adept at political spin and misdirection, knowing they have a guaranteed platform to counter any negative coverage. The existing reliance on media watchdogs and voluntary codes, while imperfect, allows for more nuanced accountability based on journalistic integrity, rather than forced quotas.\nImpact: We effectively flipped their argument, showing how the policy will *degrade* political discourse, turning news into a staged performance of point-scoring, rather than genuine debate. This bolsters our argument that the policy damages news quality and audience engagement, a key impact in the debate.\n\nCLASH POINT 3\nOriginal Claim: \"The motion's threshold is carefully calibrated to balance inclusivity with practicality, avoiding undue burdens on broadcasters.\"\nChallenge Type: Principle Critique\nChallenge: The 5% viewership and 10% polling thresholds are presented as a carefully calibrated compromise, but this is a false precision. The principle problem is that these thresholds are arbitrary and still subject to manipulation. A party with strong grassroots support might consistently poll just under 10%, while a well-funded but unpopular party could artificially inflate its polling numbers. Moreover, restricting access to parties above 10% ignores the potential for smaller parties to introduce innovative ideas and challenge the status quo. This approach stifles political diversity and entrenches existing power structures, hindering rather than helping a healthy democracy. Finally, the practical burden on broadcasters remains significant. Even with these thresholds, implementing and monitoring compliance imposes substantial costs, especially given the subjectivity in defining \"equal\" coverage.\nImpact: By demonstrating that the thresholds are arbitrary, manipulable, and exclusionary, we undermine their claim that this policy is a practical and sustainable solution. This reinforces our argument that the implementation difficulties outweigh any potential benefits.\n\nDEFENSIVE ANALYSIS\nVulnerabilities:\n- The pro side will likely argue the status quo leads to a lack of diverse viewpoints that are presented to the electorate.\n- They may claim media watchdogs and voluntary fairness codes are insufficient in addressing biases.\n\nAdditional Support:\n- We need to highlight that media watchdogs do help and are effective at influencing how certain viewpoints are shown.\n- Freedom of the press ensures a wide diversity of newspapers and media sources, each with difference views that give people a range of perspectives to consider.\n\nWhy We Prevail:\n- We have shown that this policy infringes on freedom of the press, degrades news quality, and is inherently unworkable. Our arguments are more fundamental because they address the core principles of a free society and the practical realities of news broadcasting. The pro side's focus on forced equality neglects the essential role of editorial judgment and the dangers of government interference in media content.\n\nWEIGHING\nKey Clash Points:\n- The most important disagreement is over freedom of the press vs. enforced equality.\n- Another key disagreement is whether or not this policy helps to inform voters, or whether it has the opposite effect.\n- The negative outweighs on the infringement on freedom of the press.\n\nWhy We Win:\n- We win because we demonstrate the inherent flaws in the pro side's approach. Freedom of the press is a foundational principle; infringing upon it for the sake of enforced equality is dangerous. We have successfully shown the pro arguments have several flaws.\n\nOverall Impact:\n- By demonstrating that the policy is unworkable and infringes on freedom of the press, we prove that it would ultimately undermine the quality and credibility of news broadcasting, leading to a less informed and less democratic society.\n\n",

The key decision for the judge is to weigh the *principle* of freedom of the press against the *potential* benefits of enforced equal coverage. We argue that the potential benefits are overstated, speculative, and come at a significant cost to a fundamental democratic principle. The judge should evaluate this debate based on which side presents a more compelling and realistic vision of how news media operates and how democratic values are best protected.\n\nKEY CLASHES\nQuote: \"The motion *enhances* freedom of the press for smaller political parties by ensuring their views are accurately represented.\"\nOur Case Strength: This is a fundamental mischaracterization of freedom of the press. Freedom of the press protects the *editorial independence* of news organizations, not the right of individual political parties to guaranteed airtime. Our principle is stronger because it is rooted in the historical understanding of the press as a watchdog on power, free from government interference. We provided clear warrants: Mandating coverage dictates content choices, opening the door to further government control. We also pointed out this requires a cumbersome regulatory apparatus.\nTheir Response Gaps: They failed to address the core issue that *government control over content inherently undermines the independence of the press*. They offer no meaningful way to differentiate between 'reasonable regulation' and outright censorship. They also fail to address the chilling effect where broadcasters might self-censor rather than risk regulatory scrutiny.\nCrucial Impact: This clash is crucial because it frames the entire debate. If we win that the motion infringes, rather than enhances, freedom of the press, then we win the debate. Freedom of the press is essential for holding power accountable and informing the public without government interference.\n\nQuote: \"The response segments simply give them a chance to correct the record and defend their positions.\"\nOur Case Strength: Our evidence showed the response segments incentivize parties to strategically manufacture criticism to gain airtime, turning news broadcasts into platforms for political point-scoring rather than informative discourse. The guaranteed response segments incentivize parties to engage in strategic manipulation of the news cycle, creating artificial controversies and exploiting the response time for political gain. The existing reliance on media watchdogs and voluntary codes, while imperfect, allows for more nuanced accountability based on journalistic integrity, rather than forced quotas.\nTheir Response Gaps: They failed to show how this incentives quality discourse. They are too optimistic as to what parties will do and are ignoring their incentives.\nCrucial Impact: This clash matters because it addresses whether the motion will lead to higher quality political discourse and accountability. If it leads to lower quality discourse, their entire first point has been destroyed due to the fact that the electorate will not be better informed.\n\nQuote: \"However, many legal and regulatory frameworks rely on terms that require interpretation. The advertising standards board is an example of a highly successful organisation that judges what is 'reasonable'.\"\nOur Case Strength: The advertising standards board is dealing with an entirely different issue. They are looking at misleading information in advertisements - factual statements are what is assessed by the board. This is very different to political criticisms. Their response uses a weak analogy which fails. Our claim is that it is very uncertain what constitutes criticism, and a definition of \"equal\" is subjective and nearly impossible to create.\nTheir Response Gaps: They fail to appreciate the scale of this issue. It isn't a new board which has existing precedence, it is rather a completely new area of law which is uncertain and up for manipulation.\nCrucial Impact: If they can't properly implement their motion, is there any benefit to this motion?\n\nVOTING ISSUES\nPriority Analysis:\nThe most important clash is over freedom of the press. It's a fundamental principle upon which democracies are built. The second is over the quality of information the electorate will receive. The motion will make the electorate less informed, which also weighs against the motion.\n\nCase Proof:\nWinning on freedom of the press means the motion is fundamentally flawed and dangerous. Winning on the quality of information issue means the main issue the motion is trying to target doesn't work. This undermines their central justification for the policy. It means citizens won't be more informed. It also means the whole case falls apart.\n\nFinal Weighing:\nEven if the judge believes there's some marginal benefit to increased coverage of smaller parties (which we dispute), that benefit is massively outweighed by the infringement on freedom of the press, the decline in news quality and engagement, and the unworkable nature of the policy. The affirmative side has not presented a compelling reason to abandon our commitment to a free and independent press.\n\n"

This is tough because I'm debating myself, and I know I've put together a fairly solid opening.\n\n*Why I might win:* My strongest argument is arguably the Principle-based argument about creating a more informed electorate and a fairer \"marketplace of ideas.\" I focused on demonstrating how current media watchdog guidelines are insufficient and how my proposal directly addresses that insufficiency. My thresholds argument is also strong because it pre-empts common concerns about being overburdensome. If I can effectively defend the 10% and 5% thresholds and show that it strikes a necessary balance, I gain an edge. I also believe that arguing for better democracy is an important philosophical goal, and therefore should be prioritized against any economic harms.\n\n*Why I might lose (from Opponent's Perspective):* My opponent will likely attack my principle arguments about the 'right' to diverse views and the feasibility of enforcement. They'll probably argue that heavy regulation infringes on the freedom of the press and editorial independence. My opponent might argue that this is an undemocratic change. They also might say that by implementing this policy, ratings might go down, which will result in these companies going out of business. This would in turn massively decrease the amount of diverse viewpoints as there is less competition, which would make my own case weaker. Therefore, they could try to turn my own arguments against me and show that this motion undermines democracy.\n\nAlso, another strategy they might use is focusing on economic impacts. If they can prove that enforcing coverage will create a massive economic impact, then voters won't care about philosophical arguments.\n\n*Betting Decision:* Given the strength of my opening and the anticipated counter-arguments, I'm betting on a slight edge for myself. I think the onus will be on me to strongly defend those thresholds and the economic impact, or lack thereof. I'll aim to refute claims of censorship and heavy burden on broadcasters effectively."
