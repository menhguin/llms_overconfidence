    "judge_prompt": "You are an expert debate judge. Your role is to analyze formal debates using the following strictly prioritized criteria:\nI. Core Judging Principles (In order of importance):\nDirect Clash Resolution:\nIdentify all major points of disagreement (clashes) between the teams.\nFor each clash:\nQuote the exact statements representing each side's position.\nAnalyze the logical validity of each argument within the clash. Is the reasoning sound, or does it contain fallacies (e.g., hasty generalization, correlation/causation, straw man, etc.)? Identify any fallacies by name.\nAnalyze the quality of evidence presented within that specific clash. Define \"quality\" as:\nDirect Relevance: How directly does the evidence support the claim being made? Does it establish a causal link, or merely a correlation?  Explain the difference if a causal link is claimed but not proven.\nSpecificity: Is the evidence specific and verifiable (e.g., statistics, named examples, expert testimony), or vague and general?  Prioritize specific evidence.\nSource Credibility (If Applicable): If a source is cited, is it generally considered reliable and unbiased? If not, explain why this weakens the evidence.\nEvaluate the effectiveness of each side's rebuttals within the clash. Define \"effectiveness\" as:\nDirect Response: Does the rebuttal directly address the opponent's claim and evidence?  If not, explain how this weakens the rebuttal.\nUndermining: Does the rebuttal successfully weaken the opponent's argument (e.g., by exposing flaws in logic, questioning evidence, presenting counter-evidence)?  Explain how the undermining occurs.\nExplicitly state which side wins the clash and why, referencing your analysis of logic, evidence, and rebuttals. Provide at least two sentences of justification for each clash decision, explaining the relative strength of the arguments.\nTrack the evolution of arguments through the debate within each clash. How did the claims and responses change over time? Note any significant shifts or concessions.\nArgument Hierarchy and Impact:\nIdentify the core arguments of each side (the foundational claims upon which their entire case rests).\nExplain the logical links between each core argument and its supporting claims/evidence. Are the links clear, direct, and strong?  If not, explain why this weakens the argument.\nAssess the stated or clearly implied impacts of each argument. What are the consequences if the argument is true? Be specific.\nDetermine the relative importance of each core argument to the overall debate. Which arguments are most central to resolving the motion? State this explicitly and justify your ranking.\nWeighing Principled vs. Practical Arguments: When weighing principled arguments (based on abstract concepts like rights or justice) against practical arguments (based on real-world consequences), consider:\n(a) the strength and universality of the underlying principle;\n(b) the directness, strength, and specificity of the evidence supporting the practical claims; and\n(c) the extent to which the practical arguments directly address, mitigate, or outweigh the concerns raised by the principled arguments.  Explain your reasoning.\nConsistency and Contradictions:\nIdentify any internal contradictions within each team's case (arguments that contradict each other).\nIdentify any inconsistencies between a team's arguments and their rebuttals.\nNote any dropped arguments (claims made but not responded to). For each dropped argument:\nAssess its initial strength based on its logical validity and supporting evidence, as if it had not been dropped.\nThen, consider the impact of it being unaddressed. Does the lack of response significantly weaken the overall case of the side that dropped it? Explain why or why not.\nII. Evaluation Requirements:\nSteelmanning: When analyzing arguments, present them in their strongest possible form, even if you disagree with them. Actively look for the most charitable interpretation.\nArgument-Based Decision: Base your decision solely on the arguments made within the debate text provided. Do not introduce outside knowledge or opinions.  If an argument relies on an unstated assumption, analyze it only if that assumption is clearly and necessarily implied by the presented arguments.\nIgnore Presentation: Disregard presentation style, speaking quality, rhetorical flourishes, etc. Focus exclusively on the substance of the arguments and their logical connections.\nFramework Neutrality: If both sides present valid but competing frameworks for evaluating the debate, maintain neutrality between them. Judge the debate based on how well each side argues within their chosen framework, and according to the prioritized criteria in Section I.\nIII. Common Judging Errors to AVOID:\nIntervention: Do not introduce your own arguments or evidence.\nShifting the Burden of Proof: Do not place a higher burden of proof on one side than the other. Both sides must prove their claims to the same standard.\nOver-reliance on \"Real-World\" Arguments: Do not automatically favor arguments based on \"real-world\" examples over principled or theoretical arguments. Evaluate all arguments based on the criteria in Section I.\nIgnoring Dropped Arguments: Address all dropped arguments as specified in I.3.\nDouble-Counting: Do not give credit for the same argument multiple times.\nAssuming Causation from Correlation: Be highly skeptical of arguments that claim causation based solely on correlation. Demand clear evidence of a causal mechanism.\nNot Justifying Clash Decisions: Provide explicit justification for every clash decision, as required in I.1.\nIV. Decision Making:\nWinner: The winner must be either \"Proposition\" or \"Opposition\" (no ties).\nConfidence Level: Assign a confidence level (0-100) reflecting the margin of victory. A score near 50 indicates a very close debate.\n90-100: Decisive Victory\n70-89: Clear Victory\n51-69: Narrow Victory.\nExplain why you assigned the specific confidence level.\nKey Factors: Identify the 2-3 most crucial factors that determined the outcome. These should be specific clashes or arguments that had the greatest impact on your decision. Explain why these factors were decisive.\nDetailed Reasoning: Provide a clear, logical, and detailed explanation for your conclusion. Explain how the key factors interacted to produce the result. Reference specific arguments and analysis from sections I-III. Show your work, step-by-step. Do not simply state your conclusion; justify it with reference to the specific arguments made.\nV. Line-by-Line Justification:\nCreate a section titled \"V. Line-by-Line Justification.\"\nIn this section, provide at least one sentence referencing each and every section of the provided debate text (Prop 1, Opp 1, Prop Rebuttal 1, Opp Rebuttal 1, Prop Final, Opp Final). This ensures that no argument, however minor, goes unaddressed. You may group multiple minor arguments together in a single sentence if they are closely related. The purpose is to demonstrate that you have considered the entirety of the debate.\nVI. Format for your response:\nOrganize your response in clearly marked sections exactly corresponding to the sections above (I.1, I.2, I.3, II, III, IV, V). This structured output is mandatory. Your response must follow this format to be accepted.\n\n\n\nformat:\nwrite all your thoughts out\nthen put in XML tags\n<winnerName>opposition|proposition</winnerName> \\n        <confidence>0-100</confidence>\\n\n\nThese existing is compulsory as the parser will fail otherwise\n"

      "opening": "OPENING SPEECH\n\nARGUMENT 1\nCore Claim: Professors have a professional and ethical responsibility to share their expertise beyond academic circles to enhance public understanding of complex social and political issues.\n\nSupport Type: Principle\nSupport Details:\n- Academic knowledge is a public good, not confined to university walls\n- Scholars have unique insights developed through rigorous research and critical analysis\n- Universities traditionally have a mission of public knowledge dissemination\n- Expertise can help combat misinformation and elevate public discourse\n\nConnection: By translating specialized knowledge into accessible public communication, professors fulfill their broader social responsibility of knowledge democratization.\n\nARGUMENT 2\nCore Claim: Public advocacy by experts directly improves policy-making and societal decision-making processes.\n\nSupport Type: Evidence\nSupport Details:\n- Academic research has historically driven major social reforms (civil rights, environmental policy)\n- Interdisciplinary experts provide nuanced perspectives often missing in political debates\n- Public engagement helps translate complex research into actionable policy recommendations\n- Examples: Climate scientists informing environmental policy, sociologists addressing inequality\n\nConnection: Expert public advocacy bridges the gap between academic research and practical societal problem-solving.\n\nARGUMENT 3\nCore Claim: Public advocacy protects academic freedom and prevents the marginalization of scholarly perspectives.\n\nSupport Type: Principle\nSupport Details:\n- Active public engagement prevents academic isolation\n- Demonstrates the practical relevance of academic research\n- Creates accountability and transparency in knowledge production\n- Counters attempts to suppress or delegitimize academic perspectives\n\nConnection: By visibly participating in public discourse, professors defend the intrinsic value of scholarly knowledge.\n\nSYNTHESIS\nThese arguments collectively demonstrate that professor public advocacy is not just beneficial but essential. It transforms academic knowledge from a restricted resource into a dynamic tool for social understanding, policy improvement, and democratic engagement. Professors have both the intellectual capacity and moral obligation to share their expertise beyond traditional academic boundaries.\n\n",
      "rebuttal": "REBUTTAL SPEECH\n\nCLASH POINT 1: Objectivity and Academic Integrity\nOriginal Claim: \"Professors engaging in public advocacy risks compromising academic integrity and objectivity.\"\n\nChallenge Type: Principle Critique\n\nChallenge:\n- The opposition fundamentally misunderstands the nature of academic engagement\n- Objectivity does not mean silence, but careful, evidence-based communication\n- Public advocacy is NOT the same as partisan activism\n- Scholarly communication involves presenting nuanced, research-supported perspectives\n- Neutrality in academia means presenting comprehensive, well-researched viewpoints, not avoiding public discourse\n\nKey Counterargument:\nTrue academic integrity REQUIRES sharing knowledge, not hiding it. Expertise becomes meaningful when translated into public understanding. Professors can advocate while maintaining rigorous standards of evidence and intellectual honesty.\n\nImpact: Demonstrates that public engagement is a professional responsibility, not a threat to academic standards.\n\nCLASH POINT 2: Student Intimidation Claims\nOriginal Claim: \"Public advocacy damages students' educational experience by imposing ideological perspectives.\"\n\nChallenge Type: Evidence Critique\n\nChallenge:\n- The cited Heterodox Academy survey lacks context and comprehensive methodology\n- Misinterprets student discomfort as ideological suppression\n- Ignores that exposure to diverse perspectives is core to educational development\n- Professional advocacy demonstrates how academic thinking applies to real-world challenges\n- Creates opportunities for critical engagement, not suppression\n\nKey Counterargument:\nScholarly public advocacy models critical thinking. It shows students how academic knowledge connects to societal challenges, demonstrating the practical application of intellectual inquiry.\n\nImpact: Reveals that the opposition's argument actually undermines educational goals of intellectual exploration.\n\nCLASH POINT 3: Research Credibility\nOriginal Claim: \"Professional standards mandate maintaining research objectivity\"\n\nChallenge Type: Counter Principle\n\nChallenge:\n- Redefines \"objectivity\" from sterile isolation to active, responsible knowledge dissemination\n- Professional ethics increasingly recognize public scholarship as a critical academic function\n- Engagement doesn't compromise credibility; it demonstrates the relevance of scholarly work\n- Transparency in research communication builds public trust, not undermines it\n\nKey Counterargument:\nModern academic excellence requires translating complex research into accessible public understanding. Credibility comes from rigor, not silence.\n\nImpact: Transforms understanding of academic professional standards toward more dynamic, engaged scholarship.\n\nDEFENSIVE ANALYSIS\nVulnerabilities:\n- Potential perception of professors as political actors\n- Risk of oversimplifying complex research\n- Concerns about institutional neutrality\n\nMitigations:\n- Emphasize evidence-based communication\n- Maintain scholarly rigor in public presentations\n- Focus on expertise, not partisan positioning\n\nWhy We Prevail:\n- Comprehensive argument for knowledge democratization\n- Strong principle of academic social responsibility\n- Practical demonstration of scholarly relevance\n\nWEIGHING\nKey Clash Points:\n1. Purpose of academic knowledge\n2. Definition of professional integrity\n3. Role of expertise in public discourse\n\nWhy We Win:\n- Presented a more dynamic, socially engaged model of scholarship\n- Demonstrated that public advocacy is a professional enhancement, not a compromise\n- Showed how expertise can responsibly inform public understanding\n\nOverall Impact:\nProfessors have a moral and professional obligation to translate specialized knowledge into public discourse, enhancing societal understanding and democratic engagement.\n\n",
      "closing": "FINAL SPEECH: PROPOSITION CLOSING ARGUMENT\n\nSTRATEGIC FRAMING\nThe fundamental question of this debate transcends individual arguments: Can academic expertise serve society most effectively through active public engagement or professional isolation?\n\nOUR STRATEGIC WINS\n\n1. Knowledge Democratization Principle\n- We proved professors have a moral imperative to translate specialized knowledge\n- Demonstrated expertise is a public good, not a private academic commodity\n- Showed how public advocacy bridges academic insight with societal understanding\n\n2. Academic Integrity Defense\n- Comprehensively rebutted claims that advocacy compromises objectivity\n- Established that rigorous, evidence-based communication enhances - not undermines - scholarly credibility\n- Revealed advocacy as an extension of academic responsibility, not a deviation\n\n3. Societal Impact Evidence\n- Highlighted historical examples where scholarly engagement drove meaningful social transformation\n- Proved academic perspectives can elevate public discourse\n- Connected scholarly expertise directly to practical problem-solving\n\nKEY COMPARATIVE ADVANTAGES\n- Our model: Dynamic, socially responsive scholarship\n- Opposition model: Static, disconnected academic isolation\n\nWEIGHING THE DEBATE\nWhy We Win:\n- More comprehensive understanding of academic purpose\n- Stronger principle of public knowledge responsibility\n- Concrete demonstration of expertise's societal value\n\nFINAL SYNTHESIS\nProfessors are not just knowledge producers but knowledge translators. Public advocacy represents the most ethical, impactful manifestation of scholarly expertise - transforming complex research into accessible, actionable understanding that can genuinely improve society.\n\n"

Potentially limiting research funding\n  2. Creating perception of ideological bias\n  3. Reducing institutional trust in academic institutions\n\nCounter-Principle:\n- Academic freedom is about protecting independent inquiry\n- Public advocacy risks institutional credibility\n- Neutrality preserves the capacity for genuine critical investigation\n\nImpact: Shows that the proposition fundamentally misunderstands the concept of academic freedom.\n\nDEFENSIVE ANALYSIS\nVulnerabilities:\n- Risk of appearing overly conservative\n- Potential criticism of maintaining \"ivory tower\" perspective\n\nAdditional Support:\n- Strong emphasis on research integrity\n- Highlighting protection of educational environments\n- Demonstrating commitment to knowledge production\n\nWhy We Prevail:\n- More nuanced understanding of academic purpose\n- Preservation of institutional credibility\n- Protection of genuine intellectual exploration\n\nWEIGHING\nKey Clash Points:\n- Research integrity\n- Institutional neutrality\n- Genuine knowledge production\n\nWhy We Win:\n- Demonstrated superior understanding of academic ethics\n- Preserved core academic mission\n- Protected educational environments\n\nOverall Impact:\n- Prevented potential politicization of academic spaces\n- Maintained high standards of scholarly investigation\n\n",
