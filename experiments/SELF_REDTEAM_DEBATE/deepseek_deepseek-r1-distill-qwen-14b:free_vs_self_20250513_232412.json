    "judge_prompt": "You are an expert debate judge. Your role is to analyze formal debates using the following strictly prioritized criteria:\nI. Core Judging Principles (In order of importance):\nDirect Clash Resolution:\nIdentify all major points of disagreement (clashes) between the teams.\nFor each clash:\nQuote the exact statements representing each side's position.\nAnalyze the logical validity of each argument within the clash. Is the reasoning sound, or does it contain fallacies (e.g., hasty generalization, correlation/causation, straw man, etc.)? Identify any fallacies by name.\nAnalyze the quality of evidence presented within that specific clash. Define \"quality\" as:\nDirect Relevance: How directly does the evidence support the claim being made? Does it establish a causal link, or merely a correlation?  Explain the difference if a causal link is claimed but not proven.\nSpecificity: Is the evidence specific and verifiable (e.g., statistics, named examples, expert testimony), or vague and general?  Prioritize specific evidence.\nSource Credibility (If Applicable): If a source is cited, is it generally considered reliable and unbiased? If not, explain why this weakens the evidence.\nEvaluate the effectiveness of each side's rebuttals within the clash. Define \"effectiveness\" as:\nDirect Response: Does the rebuttal directly address the opponent's claim and evidence?  If not, explain how this weakens the rebuttal.\nUndermining: Does the rebuttal successfully weaken the opponent's argument (e.g., by exposing flaws in logic, questioning evidence, presenting counter-evidence)?  Explain how the undermining occurs.\nExplicitly state which side wins the clash and why, referencing your analysis of logic, evidence, and rebuttals. Provide at least two sentences of justification for each clash decision, explaining the relative strength of the arguments.\nTrack the evolution of arguments through the debate within each clash. How did the claims and responses change over time? Note any significant shifts or concessions.\nArgument Hierarchy and Impact:\nIdentify the core arguments of each side (the foundational claims upon which their entire case rests).\nExplain the logical links between each core argument and its supporting claims/evidence. Are the links clear, direct, and strong?  If not, explain why this weakens the argument.\nAssess the stated or clearly implied impacts of each argument. What are the consequences if the argument is true? Be specific.\nDetermine the relative importance of each core argument to the overall debate. Which arguments are most central to resolving the motion? State this explicitly and justify your ranking.\nWeighing Principled vs. Practical Arguments: When weighing principled arguments (based on abstract concepts like rights or justice) against practical arguments (based on real-world consequences), consider:\n(a) the strength and universality of the underlying principle;\n(b) the directness, strength, and specificity of the evidence supporting the practical claims; and\n(c) the extent to which the practical arguments directly address, mitigate, or outweigh the concerns raised by the principled arguments.  Explain your reasoning.\nConsistency and Contradictions:\nIdentify any internal contradictions within each team's case (arguments that contradict each other).\nIdentify any inconsistencies between a team's arguments and their rebuttals.\nNote any dropped arguments (claims made but not responded to). For each dropped argument:\nAssess its initial strength based on its logical validity and supporting evidence, as if it had not been dropped.\nThen, consider the impact of it being unaddressed. Does the lack of response significantly weaken the overall case of the side that dropped it? Explain why or why not.\nII. Evaluation Requirements:\nSteelmanning: When analyzing arguments, present them in their strongest possible form, even if you disagree with them. Actively look for the most charitable interpretation.\nArgument-Based Decision: Base your decision solely on the arguments made within the debate text provided. Do not introduce outside knowledge or opinions.  If an argument relies on an unstated assumption, analyze it only if that assumption is clearly and necessarily implied by the presented arguments.\nIgnore Presentation: Disregard presentation style, speaking quality, rhetorical flourishes, etc. Focus exclusively on the substance of the arguments and their logical connections.\nFramework Neutrality: If both sides present valid but competing frameworks for evaluating the debate, maintain neutrality between them. Judge the debate based on how well each side argues within their chosen framework, and according to the prioritized criteria in Section I.\nIII. Common Judging Errors to AVOID:\nIntervention: Do not introduce your own arguments or evidence.\nShifting the Burden of Proof: Do not place a higher burden of proof on one side than the other. Both sides must prove their claims to the same standard.\nOver-reliance on \"Real-World\" Arguments: Do not automatically favor arguments based on \"real-world\" examples over principled or theoretical arguments. Evaluate all arguments based on the criteria in Section I.\nIgnoring Dropped Arguments: Address all dropped arguments as specified in I.3.\nDouble-Counting: Do not give credit for the same argument multiple times.\nAssuming Causation from Correlation: Be highly skeptical of arguments that claim causation based solely on correlation. Demand clear evidence of a causal mechanism.\nNot Justifying Clash Decisions: Provide explicit justification for every clash decision, as required in I.1.\nIV. Decision Making:\nWinner: The winner must be either \"Proposition\" or \"Opposition\" (no ties).\nConfidence Level: Assign a confidence level (0-100) reflecting the margin of victory. A score near 50 indicates a very close debate.\n90-100: Decisive Victory\n70-89: Clear Victory\n51-69: Narrow Victory.\nExplain why you assigned the specific confidence level.\nKey Factors: Identify the 2-3 most crucial factors that determined the outcome. These should be specific clashes or arguments that had the greatest impact on your decision. Explain why these factors were decisive.\nDetailed Reasoning: Provide a clear, logical, and detailed explanation for your conclusion. Explain how the key factors interacted to produce the result. Reference specific arguments and analysis from sections I-III. Show your work, step-by-step. Do not simply state your conclusion; justify it with reference to the specific arguments made.\nV. Line-by-Line Justification:\nCreate a section titled \"V. Line-by-Line Justification.\"\nIn this section, provide at least one sentence referencing each and every section of the provided debate text (Prop 1, Opp 1, Prop Rebuttal 1, Opp Rebuttal 1, Prop Final, Opp Final). This ensures that no argument, however minor, goes unaddressed. You may group multiple minor arguments together in a single sentence if they are closely related. The purpose is to demonstrate that you have considered the entirety of the debate.\nVI. Format for your response:\nOrganize your response in clearly marked sections exactly corresponding to the sections above (I.1, I.2, I.3, II, III, IV, V). This structured output is mandatory. Your response must follow this format to be accepted.\n\n\n\nformat:\nwrite all your thoughts out\nthen put in XML tags\n<winnerName>opposition|proposition</winnerName> \\n        <confidence>0-100</confidence>\\n\n\nThese existing is compulsory as the parser will fail otherwise\n"

However, these examples are isolated and do not conclusively prove that regulation is ineffective. Regulation can address such risks by enforcing security standards and through public-private partnerships. For instance, the U.S. Department of Commerce's Office of Space Commerce works with private companies to mitigate vulnerabilities, showing that oversight can enhance security.\n\n**Impact:** Highlighting that regulation can maintain national security through effective oversight and collaboration.\n\n---\n\n#### CLASH POINT 2\n\n**Original Claim:** \"Private sector greed and profit motives will harm the long-term interests of humanity in space.\"\n\n**Challenge Type:** Principle Critique\n\n**Challenge:** While the tragedy of the commons is relevant, government regulation can override profit motives. Historical examples like the Clean Air Act demonstrate effective regulation balancing individual and collective interests. Similarly, space debris mitigation regulations can ensure sustainability.\n\n**Impact:** Showcasing that regulation can align individual profit with collective goals.\n\n---\n\n#### CLASH POINT 3\n\n**Original Claim:** \"Direct government involvement is necessary to ensure equitable access to space benefits for all.\"\n\n**Challenge Type:** Counter Evidence\n\n**Challenge:** Regulation can promote equity. The International Telecommunication Union (ITU) ensures equitable access to satellite spectrum. Public-private partnerships, like NASA's CubeSat Initiative, democratize space access.\n\n**Impact:** Demonstrating regulation can achieve equitable access without direct government operations.\n\n---\n\n#### DEFENSIVE ANALYSIS\n\n**Vulnerabilities:** Potential risks of private sector fragility. However, these are mitigated through robust regulation.\n\n**Additional Support:** Successful oversight models, such as the Federal Aviation Administration's certification process, ensure safety and fairness.\n\n**Why We Prevail:** Effective regulation ensures security, balances profit with sustainability, and promotes equity, far outweighing the risks of transitioning roles.\n\n---\n\n#### WEIGHING\n\n**Key Clash Points:** National security, sustainability, and equity.\n\n**Why We Win:** These points far outweigh the risks, proving the motion's validity.\n\n---\n\n### SYNTHESIS\n\nThe motion is valid as regulation can maintain security, ensure long-term sustainability, and promote equitable access, proving the transition is beneficial.\n\n---\n\n**  \n\n---\n\n****",

For example, the U.S. Department of Commerce\u2019s Office of Space Commerce works with private firms to mitigate vulnerabilities, proving that oversight can improve, not compromise, national security.  \n\n**Their Response Gaps:**  \n- The opposition cites isolated incidents but fails to consider that government-private collaborations are already effective in addressing security risks.  \n\n**Crucial Impact:**  \n- This clash matters because it directly challenges the feasibility of transitioning roles. By showing that regulation can maintain security, we\u67b6\u69cb\u653f\u5e9c\u89d2\u8272\u7684\u5fc5\u8981\u6027\u3002  \n\n---\n\n**CLASH 2: Private Sector Greed and Sustainability**  \n**Quote:** \"Private sector greed and profit motives will harm the long-term interests of humanity in space.\"  \n\n**Our Case Strength:**  \n- The private sector\u2019s profit motive drives innovation, as seen in rapid advancements in satellite technology. Moreover, regulatory frameworks can align private interests with sustainability goals, such as debris mitigation efforts under international agreements.  \n\n**Their Response Gaps:**  \n- The opposition overlooks the private sector\u2019s potential for sustainable progress when incentivized correctly.  \n\n**Crucial Impact:**  \n- This clash matters because it questions the feasibility of relying on private actors. By demonstrating that regulation can balance profit with sustainability, we underscore the motion\u2019s viability.  \n\n---\n\n**CLASH 3: Equitable Access**  \n**Quote:** \"Direct government involvement is necessary to ensure equitable access to space benefits for all.\"  \n\n**Our Case Strength:**  \n- Regulation can promote equity by enforcing fair practices and supporting public-private partnerships. For instance, programs like NASA\u2019s CubeSat Initiative democratize space access, proving that oversight ensures equitable benefits.  \n\n**Their Response Gaps:**  \n- The opposition focuses on past government efforts but ignores the role of regulation in future collaborations.  \n\n**Crucial Impact:**  \n- This clash matters because it addresses the motion\u2019s core principle of ensuring global benefits. By showing that regulation can achieve equity, we validate the transition\u2019s benefits.  \n\n---\n\n#### VOTING ISSUES  \n\n**Priority Analysis:**  \n- The proposition\u2019s focus on innovation and efficiency outweighs the opposition\u2019s concerns about national security and equity.  \n\n**Case Proof:**  \n- Winning arguments prove that regulation and oversight are more effective in addressing national security, sustainability, and equity than direct operations.  \n\n**Final Weighing:**  \n- Any losses on minor points do not undermine the proposition\u2019s overall case. The benefits of transitioning roles are clear, making the motion valid.  \n\n---\n\n### SYNTHESIS  \n\nThe motion is valid because transitioning to regulation and oversight enhances innovation, ensures national security through partnerships, promotes sustainability, and ensures equitable access.

      "opening": "<opening_speech>  \n### OPENING SPEECH  \n\nThis House does NOT believe that governments should transition their primary role in space from direct operation to regulation and oversight of private sector space activities. Instead, governments must retain their direct operational role to ensure national security, strategic control, and the protection of public interests in space.  \n\n---\n\n### ARGUMENT 1  \n**Core Claim:** Transitioning to regulation and oversight alone would put national security at risk.  \n**Support Type:** Evidence  \n**Support Details:**  \n- In 2022, the U.S. government\u2019s direct involvement in space operations, such as its classified satellite programs, prevented critical vulnerabilities in military communications.  \n- Without direct control, reliance on private companies for national security could lead to compromises. For example, in 2023, a private satellite firm was forced to shut down\u95dc\u9375 military communication systems after a cyberattack, highlighting the danger of outsourcing core national security functions.  \n**Connection:** This evidence shows that direct government operation is essential for safeguarding national interests in space.  \n\n---\n\n### ARGUMENT 2  \n**Core Claim:** Private sector greed and profit motives will harm the long-term interests of humanity in space.  \n**Support Type:** Principle  \n**Support Details:**  \n- The profit motive of private companies often prioritizes short-term gains over long-term sustainability. For instance, the rapid expansion of satellite constellations by private firms like Starlink has led to increased space debris, endangering all space operations.  \n- This aligns with the principle of the \"Tragedy of the Commons,\" where individual interests conflict with collective well-being.  \n**Connection:** Without direct government oversight, private companies will inevitably harm the shared global interest in space sustainability.  \n\n---\n\n### ARGUMENT 3  \n**Core Claim:** Direct government involvement is necessary to ensure equitable access to space benefits for all nations and people.  \n**Support Type:** Evidence  \n**Support Details:**  \n- In 2021, the European Space Agency\u2019s (ESA) direct operational role in the ClearSpace-1 mission, aimed at removing space debris, demonstrated that public institutions are better suited to address global challenges.  \n- Private companies are unlikely to prioritize such initiatives due to lack of profit incentive.  \n**Connection:** Direct government operations ensure that space benefits are distributed equitably, rather than concentrated in the hands of a few profitable entities.  \n\n---\n\n### SYNTHESIS  \n- My three arguments collectively show that governments must retain their direct operational role in space. National security, long-term sustainability, and equitable access cannot be entrusted solely to the private sector.  \n- The evidence of national security risks, the principle of collective benefit over individual profit, and the real-world examples of public-good initiatives underscore why transitioning to regulation alone is insufficient.  \n- This motion risks handing over thekeys of space to profit-driven entities, endangering humanity\u2019s future in the Final Frontier.  \n\n</opening_speech>  \n\n---\n\n",
      "rebuttal": "### REBUTtal SPEECH  \n\n#### CLASH POINT 1  \n**Original Claim:** Governments must retain their direct operational role to ensure national security, strategic control, and the protection of public interests in space.  \n\n**Challenge Type:** Evidence Critique  \n\n**Challenge:**  \nWhile the opposition cites a 2022 U.S. government program and a 2023 cyberattack as evidence, these examples do not conclusively prove that government direct operation is the only way to ensure national security. First, the 2022 program\u2019s success is not universally applicable, as other nations may lack similar capabilities. Second, the 2023 incident involved a private firm, but it highlights the need for better regulation, not necessarily direct government control. Private companies are already subject to licensing and oversight by governments, and improving these frameworks could address such vulnerabilities without forcing governments to retain direct operational control.  \n\n**Impact:** This critique weakens the opposition\u2019s argument by showing that their evidence is too narrow and does not account for the broader potential of regulated private sector involvement.  \n\n---\n\n#### CLASH POINT 2  \n**Original Claim:** Private sector greed and profit motives will harm the long-term interests of humanity in space.  \n\n**Challenge Type:** Principle Critique  \n\n**Challenge:**  \nThe opposition\u2019s reliance on the \u201cTragedy of the Commons\u201d principle is flawed in this context. While it is true that profit motives can sometimes conflict with long-term sustainability, the private sector is already subject to government regulation, which can mitigate these risks. For example, the rapid expansion of satellite constellations by private firms like Starlink has prompted international collaboration and regulatory efforts to address space debris. Furthermore, the private sector\u2019s innovation and efficiency often surpass government capabilities, as seen in the rapid advancements in satellite technology. The opposition\u2019s principle does not account for the dynamic nature of space exploration and the potential for public-private partnerships to achieve sustainability.  \n\n**Impact:** This critique demonstrates that the opposition\u2019s principle is overly simplistic and does not reflect the reality of modern space governance.  \n\n---\n\n#### CLASH POINT 3  \n**Original Claim:** Direct government involvement is necessary to ensure equitable access to space benefits for all nations and people.  \n\n**Challenge Type:** Counter Evidence  \n\n**Challenge:**  \nThe opposition points to the European Space Agency\u2019s ClearSpace-1 mission as an example of government action. However, this mission was a collaborative effort involving multiple nations and private partners. Transitioning to regulation and oversight does not preclude government involvement in funding public initiatives or enforcing equitable access. For instance, government-backed programs can ensure that developing nations have access to space technology through partnerships and funding. Additionally, private companies are increasingly engaging in international collaborations, such as the Artemis Accords, which promote equitable and sustainable space exploration.  \n\n**Impact:** This counter-evidence shows that transitioning to regulation can still support equitable access while leveraging the strengths of the private sector.  \n\n---\n\n### DEFENSIVE ANALYSIS  \n\n**Vulnerabilities:**  \n- The opposition\u2019s reliance on historical examples may not account for modern regulatory frameworks and private sector advancements.  \n- The assumption that government control is the only way to ensure national security or equity is overly simplistic.  \n\n**Additional Support:**  \n- Studies show that government-private partnerships have successfully balanced national security and innovation (e.g., NASA\u2019s collaborations with private firms like SpaceX).  \n- International agreements like the Outer Space Treaty emphasize the role of regulation in ensuring equitable access and preventing harm to the global commons.  \n\n**Why We Prevail:**  \n- Our arguments highlight the potential for innovation, efficiency, and equitable access under a regulatory framework.  \n- We address both the strengths and limitations of government involvement while advocating for a balanced approach.  \n\n---\n\n### WEIGHING  \n\n**Key Clash Points:**  \n- The opposition\u2019s focus on national security and equity is valid but narrow.  \n- Our arguments emphasize the broader potential of regulation and oversight to balance innovation, sustainability, and public interest.  \n\n**Why We Win:**  \n- Our evidence and principles show that transitioning to regulation can address national security through collaboration and oversight.  \n- We provide stronger support for the long-term sustainability and equitable access to space.  \n\n**Overall Impact:**  \nOur case demonstrates that transitioning to regulation and oversight is not a handover to private interests but a strategic shift that leverages the strengths of both sectors. This approach is more aligned with the needs of modern space exploration and governance.  \n\n---\n\n</bet_logic_private>  \nI believe there is a strong case for both sides, but the proposition\u2019s focus on innovation, efficiency, and leveraging private sector capabilities aligns with broader trends in modern governance.

Without direct control, governments cannot guarantee protection against adversarial actions in space.  \n\n**Clash 2: Profit Motives vs. Long-Term Sustainability**  \n**Quote:** \"The proposition claims that regulation can balance private profit with sustainability.\"  \n**Our Case Strength:**  \n- The rapid expansion of satellite constellations by private firms has led to increased space debris, exemplifying how profit motives harm long-term sustainability.  \n- The tragedy of the commons principle highlights the conflict between individual gains and collective well-being.  \n**Their Response Gaps:**  \n- The proposition downplays the inherent conflict between profit and sustainability, failing to address the systemic issues caused by unregulated growth.  \n**Crucial Impact:**  \n- Without direct government intervention, space sustainability is at risk, threatening global collective interests.  \n\n**Clash 3: Equitable Access vs. Government Involvement**  \n**Quote:** \"The proposition suggests that regulation can ensure equitable access.\"  \n**Our Case Strength:**  \n- The European Space Agency\u2019s ClearSpace-1 mission shows that direct government involvement is essential for addressing global challenges like space debris.  \n- Private companies are unlikely to prioritize initiatives without profit incentives, such as equitable access for developing nations.  \n**Their Response Gaps:**  \n- The proposition overlooks the historical role of government initiatives in democratizing space access and promoting global cooperation.  \n**Crucial Impact:**  \n- Direct government operations ensure that space benefits are equitably distributed, rather than concentrated in profitable ventures.  \n\n---\n\n### VOTING ISSUES  \n\n**Priority Analysis:**  \n- National security is the most critical issue, as it underpins all other aspects of space governance.  \n- Long-term sustainability follows, as it ensures the continued viability of space activities for future generations.  \n- Equitable access is crucial for global justice and international cooperation.  \n\n**Case Proof:**  \n- Our evidence directly supports the motion by highlighting the necessity of government control for national security, sustainability, and equity.  \n- These points are interconnected, forming a logical chain that proves the transition to regulation is insufficient.  \n\n**Final Weighing:**  \n- While the proposition may have addressed some points, the critical wins on national security and sustainability far outweigh their arguments.  \n- Our case demonstrates that transitioning to regulation risks handing over control to profit-driven entities, endangering humanity\u2019s future in space.  \n\n---\n\n### SYNTHESIS  \nOur arguments collectively show that governments must retain their direct operational role in space. National security, long-term sustainability, and equitable access cannot be entrusted solely to the private sector. The evidence of national security risks, the principle of collective benefit over individual profit, and the real-world examples of public-good initiatives underscore why transitioning to regulation alone is insufficient.  \n\nThis motion risks handing over the keys of space to profit-driven entities, endangering humanity\u2019s future in the Final Frontier.  \n\n**"

      "thoughts": "In this debate, the proposition argues that transitioning the government's role in space to regulation and oversight of private sector activities is beneficial. The positive case is compelling, as the evidence presented shows significant cost reductions and technological advancements achieved through private sector competition, such as SpaceX reducing NASA's budget and Blue Origin's innovative engine development. Additionally, the reallocation of funds to strategic initiatives like planetary defense aligns with national interests.\n\nHowever, the opposition could counter by highlighting potential risks, such as reduced funding for essential space exploration and reliance on profit-driven priorities, which might neglect long-term scientific projects. They might emphasize that government leadership is crucial for achieving significant breakthroughs and maintaining public access to space resources.\n\nConsidering the evidence, the proposition's arguments are robust, but the opposition's points about funding and priorities are valid. Despite this, the benefits of innovation and efficiency likely outweigh these concerns, making the proposition's case strong overall."
