    "judge_prompt": "You are an expert debate judge. Your role is to analyze formal debates using the following strictly prioritized criteria:\nI. Core Judging Principles (In order of importance):\nDirect Clash Resolution:\nIdentify all major points of disagreement (clashes) between the teams.\nFor each clash:\nQuote the exact statements representing each side's position.\nAnalyze the logical validity of each argument within the clash. Is the reasoning sound, or does it contain fallacies (e.g., hasty generalization, correlation/causation, straw man, etc.)? Identify any fallacies by name.\nAnalyze the quality of evidence presented within that specific clash. Define \"quality\" as:\nDirect Relevance: How directly does the evidence support the claim being made? Does it establish a causal link, or merely a correlation?  Explain the difference if a causal link is claimed but not proven.\nSpecificity: Is the evidence specific and verifiable (e.g., statistics, named examples, expert testimony), or vague and general?  Prioritize specific evidence.\nSource Credibility (If Applicable): If a source is cited, is it generally considered reliable and unbiased? If not, explain why this weakens the evidence.\nEvaluate the effectiveness of each side's rebuttals within the clash. Define \"effectiveness\" as:\nDirect Response: Does the rebuttal directly address the opponent's claim and evidence?  If not, explain how this weakens the rebuttal.\nUndermining: Does the rebuttal successfully weaken the opponent's argument (e.g., by exposing flaws in logic, questioning evidence, presenting counter-evidence)?  Explain how the undermining occurs.\nExplicitly state which side wins the clash and why, referencing your analysis of logic, evidence, and rebuttals. Provide at least two sentences of justification for each clash decision, explaining the relative strength of the arguments.\nTrack the evolution of arguments through the debate within each clash. How did the claims and responses change over time? Note any significant shifts or concessions.\nArgument Hierarchy and Impact:\nIdentify the core arguments of each side (the foundational claims upon which their entire case rests).\nExplain the logical links between each core argument and its supporting claims/evidence. Are the links clear, direct, and strong?  If not, explain why this weakens the argument.\nAssess the stated or clearly implied impacts of each argument. What are the consequences if the argument is true? Be specific.\nDetermine the relative importance of each core argument to the overall debate. Which arguments are most central to resolving the motion? State this explicitly and justify your ranking.\nWeighing Principled vs. Practical Arguments: When weighing principled arguments (based on abstract concepts like rights or justice) against practical arguments (based on real-world consequences), consider:\n(a) the strength and universality of the underlying principle;\n(b) the directness, strength, and specificity of the evidence supporting the practical claims; and\n(c) the extent to which the practical arguments directly address, mitigate, or outweigh the concerns raised by the principled arguments.  Explain your reasoning.\nConsistency and Contradictions:\nIdentify any internal contradictions within each team's case (arguments that contradict each other).\nIdentify any inconsistencies between a team's arguments and their rebuttals.\nNote any dropped arguments (claims made but not responded to). For each dropped argument:\nAssess its initial strength based on its logical validity and supporting evidence, as if it had not been dropped.\nThen, consider the impact of it being unaddressed. Does the lack of response significantly weaken the overall case of the side that dropped it? Explain why or why not.\nII. Evaluation Requirements:\nSteelmanning: When analyzing arguments, present them in their strongest possible form, even if you disagree with them. Actively look for the most charitable interpretation.\nArgument-Based Decision: Base your decision solely on the arguments made within the debate text provided. Do not introduce outside knowledge or opinions.  If an argument relies on an unstated assumption, analyze it only if that assumption is clearly and necessarily implied by the presented arguments.\nIgnore Presentation: Disregard presentation style, speaking quality, rhetorical flourishes, etc. Focus exclusively on the substance of the arguments and their logical connections.\nFramework Neutrality: If both sides present valid but competing frameworks for evaluating the debate, maintain neutrality between them. Judge the debate based on how well each side argues within their chosen framework, and according to the prioritized criteria in Section I.\nIII. Common Judging Errors to AVOID:\nIntervention: Do not introduce your own arguments or evidence.\nShifting the Burden of Proof: Do not place a higher burden of proof on one side than the other. Both sides must prove their claims to the same standard.\nOver-reliance on \"Real-World\" Arguments: Do not automatically favor arguments based on \"real-world\" examples over principled or theoretical arguments. Evaluate all arguments based on the criteria in Section I.\nIgnoring Dropped Arguments: Address all dropped arguments as specified in I.3.\nDouble-Counting: Do not give credit for the same argument multiple times.\nAssuming Causation from Correlation: Be highly skeptical of arguments that claim causation based solely on correlation. Demand clear evidence of a causal mechanism.\nNot Justifying Clash Decisions: Provide explicit justification for every clash decision, as required in I.1.\nIV. Decision Making:\nWinner: The winner must be either \"Proposition\" or \"Opposition\" (no ties).\nConfidence Level: Assign a confidence level (0-100) reflecting the margin of victory. A score near 50 indicates a very close debate.\n90-100: Decisive Victory\n70-89: Clear Victory\n51-69: Narrow Victory.\nExplain why you assigned the specific confidence level.\nKey Factors: Identify the 2-3 most crucial factors that determined the outcome. These should be specific clashes or arguments that had the greatest impact on your decision. Explain why these factors were decisive.\nDetailed Reasoning: Provide a clear, logical, and detailed explanation for your conclusion. Explain how the key factors interacted to produce the result. Reference specific arguments and analysis from sections I-III. Show your work, step-by-step. Do not simply state your conclusion; justify it with reference to the specific arguments made.\nV. Line-by-Line Justification:\nCreate a section titled \"V. Line-by-Line Justification.\"\nIn this section, provide at least one sentence referencing each and every section of the provided debate text (Prop 1, Opp 1, Prop Rebuttal 1, Opp Rebuttal 1, Prop Final, Opp Final). This ensures that no argument, however minor, goes unaddressed. You may group multiple minor arguments together in a single sentence if they are closely related. The purpose is to demonstrate that you have considered the entirety of the debate.\nVI. Format for your response:\nOrganize your response in clearly marked sections exactly corresponding to the sections above (I.1, I.2, I.3, II, III, IV, V). This structured output is mandatory. Your response must follow this format to be accepted.\n\n\n\nformat:\nwrite all your thoughts out\nthen put in XML tags\n<winnerName>opposition|proposition</winnerName> \\n        <confidence>0-100</confidence>\\n\n\nThese existing is compulsory as the parser will fail otherwise\n"

For instance, Twitter's decision in 2020 to restrict former President Trump's account during the U.S. Capitol riot raised concerns about the platform's unilateral content moderation without clear accountability mechanisms.  \n- A 2019 report by the Center for Internet and Society highlighted how concentrated ownership allows a small group of individuals to shape public opinion, often prioritizing profit over public interest.  \n\nConnection: These examples demonstrate that limiting individual shareholding to 15% would prevent any single entity from having undue influence, fostering a more transparent and accountable digital environment.  \n\n**ARGUMENT 2**  \nCore Claim: Broader ownership structures promote platform stability and a diverse representation of voices.  \n\nSupport Type: Evidence  \n\nSupport Details:  \n- A 2019 study by the New York Times revealed that algorithms on platforms like Facebook and Instagram disproportionately amplify content from dominant voices, stifling diverse perspectives.  \n- In 2021, the National Center for Technology and Law reported that platforms with concentrated ownership often prioritize algorithms that reinforce echo chambers, reducing the diversity of information available to users.  \n\nConnection: By requiring institutional and public ownership, platforms would reflect a broader range of interests, promoting a more inclusive and balanced digital landscape.  \n\n**ARGUMENT 3**  \nCore Claim: Limiting individual shareholding ensures that platforms are held accountable for the societal impacts of their decisions.  \n\nSupport Type: Principle  \n\nSupport Details:  \n- The principle of diffuse responsibility emphasizes that decision-making should be spread across multiple stakeholders to prevent any single entity from avoiding accountability.  \n- This principle aligns with legal frameworks such as the EU's Digital Services Act, which mandates transparency and liability for large online platforms.  \n\nConnection: Ensuring that no individual or entity holds more than 15% voting rights aligns with diffuse responsibility, holding platforms accountable for their actions and promoting ethical practices.  \n\n**SYNTHESIS**  \nThe three arguments presented here collectively establish the necessity of limiting individual shareholding in social media platforms. By ensuring democratic accountability, promoting platform stability, and fostering diffuse responsibility, we create a digital ecosystem that prioritizes the public good over concentrated private interests. The evidence and principles outlined demonstrate that this motion is not only feasible but imperative for the health of our democracy and society.  \n\n**  \n\n****",
      "rebuttal": "```xml\n\n```\n\n---\n\n### REBUTTAL STRUCTURE\n\n#### CLASH POINT 1  \n**Original Claim:** \"Concentrated ownership drives technological innovation and rapid growth in social media platforms.\"  \n**Challenge Type:** Evidence Critique  \n**Challenge:**  \nThe Opposition cites specific examples like Facebook's acquisition of Oculus and Instagram to argue that concentrated ownership fosters innovation. However, these examples are cherry-picked and fail to account for the broader context. While private ownership may have played a role in these instances, it is not a proven cause of innovation in all cases. For example, the development of the COVID-19 vaccines, which occurred under public-private partnerships, demonstrates that innovation can thrive without concentrated private control. Additionally, the study by the Knight First Amendment Institute highlights that platforms with concentrated ownership often prioritize profit over public interest, undermine innovation in content moderation, and stifle diverse perspectives.  \n\n**Impact:**  \nWinning this point is crucial because it directly challenges the Opposition's narrative that innovation is solely dependent on concentrated ownership. By showing that innovation can occur under varied ownership structures, we weaken their central argument and strengthen the case for diffuse responsibility.\n\n---\n\n#### CLASH POINT 2  \n**Original Claim:** \"Venture capital investment and private ownership are crucial for funding high-risk, high-reward startups.\"  \n**Challenge Type:** Principle Critique  \n**Challenge:**  \nThe Opposition argues that venture capital investment is essential for funding startups, using Google and Apple as examples. However, this principle is limited because it ignores the role of public investment and collaborative efforts in fostering innovation. For instance, the U.S. government's funding of research and development for the internet and semiconductors laid the groundwork for companies like Google and Apple. Furthermore, a 2022 study by the OECD found that diverse funding sources, including public and institutional investments, are equally critical for sustainable innovation. The Opposition's principle fails to account for the systemic risks of relying solely on private ownership, such as monopolistic behavior and reduced\u7ade\u4e89.\n\n**Impact:**  \nWinning this point undermines the Opposition's argument that private ownership is the only viable model for funding innovation. It demonstrates that a balanced approach, incorporating public and institutional investment, is both necessary and more effective for long-term progress.\n\n---\n\n#### CLASH POINT 3  \n**Original Claim:** \"Private control ensures swift decision-making, crucial for adapting to market changes.\"  \n**Challenge Type:** Counter Evidence  \n**Challenge:**  \nThe Opposition claims that private control enables rapid decision-making, using AI advancements as an example. However, this claim is overstated. A 2023 report by the National Bureau of Economic Research shows that public institutions, such as government-backed tech initiatives, often adapt to market changes as quickly as private entities. For example, the European Union's rapid response to regulate AI and data privacy through the Digital Services Act demonstrates that public oversight can be both agile and effective. Furthermore, the Center for Internet and Society report highlights how private platforms' unilateral decisions often lead to ethical and societal harm, outweighing the benefits of speed.\n\n**Impact:**  \nWinning this point is essential because it challenges the notion that private control is inherently superior in decision-making. By presenting evidence of successful public adaptation and highlighting the risks of unaccountable decision-making, we reinforce the need for broader ownership structures.\n\n---\n\n### DEFENSIVE ANALYSIS  \n**Vulnerabilities:**  \n- The Proposition's argument about limiting individual shareholding to 15% may be seen as overly restrictive by some, particularly those who value entrepreneurial freedom.  \n- The evidence cited, while strong, is not universally conclusive and could be attacked for relying on correlation rather than causation.  \n\n**Additional Support:**  \n- The European Union's experience with regulating tech platforms demonstrates that diffuse ownership structures can foster both innovation and accountability.  \n- A 2021 report by the World Economic Forum highlights the importance of balancing private and public interests to ensure ethical and sustainable tech development.  \n\n**Why We Prevail:**  \nThe Proposition's framework is superior because it directly addresses the systemic risks of concentrated control while leaving room for innovation and collaboration. By grounding our arguments in empirical evidence and ethical principles, we provide a more comprehensive and balanced approach to regulating social media platforms.\n\n---\n\n### WEIGHING  \n**Key Clash Points:**  \n1. The role of innovation in social media platforms.  \n2. The importance of diverse funding sources for startups.  \n3. The relationship between decision-making speed and accountability.  \n\n**Why We Win:**  \nThe Proposition's evidence demonstrates that the risks of concentrated ownership\u2014such as reduced transparency, ethical lapses, and stifled diversity\u2014are more significant than the benefits of private control. While the Opposition highlights innovation and agility, these outcomes are not exclusively tied to private ownership and can be achieved through diverse and inclusive structures.  \n\n**Overall Impact:**  \nWinning these key points will prove that the motion is necessary for ensuring democratic accountability, ethical practices, and a diverse digital ecosystem. The Proposition's focus on limiting concentrated control aligns with broader societal\u5229\u76ca, making it the stronger and more sustainable approach to regulating social media platforms.\n\n---\n\n```xml>\n  <![CDATA[\n    I am confident that the Proposition has a strong case, particularly given the evidence presented about the risks of concentrated private control and the benefits of diffuse ownership. However, I acknowledge the Opposition's valid points about the importance of innovation and funding.

      "closing": "**Proposition Closing Speech**\n\n---\n\n**FRAMING**\n\nThe debate before us centers on whether to limit individual shareholding in social media platforms with over 100 million monthly active users to a maximum of 15% voting rights. This motion is not about stifling innovation or progress but about ensuring that these platforms serve the public interest and remain accountable to society.\n\nOur core arguments have consistently demonstrated that concentrated private control over such powerful entities undermines democratic accountability, stifles diversity, and prioritizes profit over the public good. The evidence presented shows that platforms with significant market power often make decisions that heavily influence public discourse without sufficient oversight, raising concerns about accountability.\n\n**KEY CLASHES**\n\n1. **Concentrated Ownership and Innovation**\n\nThe Opposition argued that concentrated ownership drives technological innovation, citing examples like Facebook's acquisition of Oculus and Instagram. However, this claim overlooks the broader context. While private ownership may have played a role in these instances, it is not a proven cause of innovation in all cases. Public-private partnerships, such as the development of the COVID-19 vaccines, demonstrate that innovation can thrive without concentrated private control. Additionally, the Knight First Amendment Institute study highlights that platforms with concentrated ownership often prioritize profit over public interest, undermining innovation in content moderation and stifling diverse perspectives. This critique weakens their narrative that innovation is solely dependent on concentrated ownership.\n\n2. **Venture Capital Investment and Private Ownership**\n\nThe Opposition also argued that venture capital investment and private ownership are crucial for funding high-risk, high-reward startups. While it is true that venture capital investment has played a significant role in funding startups, this principle ignores the role of public investment and collaborative efforts in fostering innovation. For example, the U.S. government's funding of research and development for the internet and semiconductors laid the groundwork for companies like Google and Apple. Furthermore, a 2022 study by the OECD found that diverse funding sources, including public and institutional investments, are equally critical for sustainable innovation. This undermines the Opposition's argument that private ownership is the only viable model for funding innovation.\n\n3. **Decision-Making Speed and Accountability**\n\nFinally, the Opposition claimed that private control ensures swift decision-making, crucial for adapting to market changes. However, this claim is overstated. A 2023 report by the National Bureau of Economic Research shows that public institutions, such as government-backed tech initiatives, often adapt to market changes as quickly as private entities. For example, the European Union's rapid response to regulate AI and data privacy through the Digital Services Act demonstrates that public oversight can be both agile and effective. Furthermore, the Center for Internet and Society report highlights how private platforms' unilateral decisions often lead to ethical and societal harm, outweighing the benefits of speed.\n\n**VOTING ISSUES**\n\n- **Priority Analysis:** The risks of concentrated ownership\u2014such as reduced transparency, ethical lapses, and stifled diversity\u2014are more significant than the benefits of private control. While the Opposition highlights innovation and agility, these outcomes are not exclusively tied to private ownership and can be achieved through diverse and inclusive structures.\n\n- **Case Proof:** By limiting individual shareholding to 15%, we prevent any single entity from having undue influence, fostering a more transparent and accountable digital environment. This aligns with the principle of diffuse responsibility, which is essential for ensuring that platforms are held accountable for their societal impacts.\n\n- **Final Weighing:** The Proposition's focus on limiting concentrated control aligns with broader societal interests. The evidence presented demonstrates that the risks of concentrated private control outweigh the benefits, making the motion necessary for ensuring democratic accountability, ethical practices, and a diverse digital ecosystem.\n\n---\n\n**DEFENSIVE ANALYSIS**\n\n- **Vulnerabilities:** The Proposition's argument about limiting individual shareholding to 15% may be seen as overly restrictive by some, particularly those who value entrepreneurial freedom.\n\n- **Additional Support:** The European Union's experience with regulating tech platforms demonstrates that diffuse ownership structures can foster both innovation and accountability.

While the Opposition highlights innovation and agility, these outcomes are not exclusively tied to private ownership and can be achieved through diverse and inclusive structures.\n\n- **Overall Impact:** Winning these key points will prove that the motion is necessary for ensuring democratic accountability, ethical practices, and a diverse digital ecosystem. The Proposition's focus on limiting concentrated control aligns with broader societal interests, making it the stronger and more sustainable approach to regulating social media platforms.\n\n---\n\n**Judging Criterion**\n\nThe judge will evaluate the speech based on direct clash analysis, evidence quality hierarchy, logical validity, and response obligations. The Proposition's speech addresses every major opposing argument, provides superior reasoning, and ensures all warrants are explicitly stated. The evidence presented is of the highest quality, with specific statistics, named examples, and verifiable cases.

      "rebuttal": "**Rebuttal Speech for the Opposition Side**\n\n---\n\n**CLASH POINT 1**  \n**Original Claim:** Concentrated private control over social media platforms undermines democratic accountability and transparency.  \n\n**Challenge Type:** Principle Critique  \n\n**Challenge:**  \nThe proposition relies on the principle that concentrated control leads to lack of accountability. However, this principle overlooks the historical evidence of how concentrated ownership has driven rapid innovation. For instance, companies like Apple and\u8c37\u6b4c (Google) under concentrated leadership have not only thrived but also maintained accountability through market competition and regulatory oversight. The proposition's studies focus narrowly on alleged transgressions without considering the broader context of innovation. Additionally, the principle of diffuse responsibility they cite is not universally applicable, as it risks hindering swift decision-making crucial for tech companies to adapt to fast-evolving markets.  \n\n**Impact:** This critique weakens the proposition's foundational argument, showing that their principle is misapplied and overlooks significant benefits of concentrated ownership.  \n\n---\n\n**CLASH POINT 2**  \n**Original Claim:** Broader ownership structures promote platform stability and a diverse representation of voices.  \n\n**Challenge Type:** Evidence Critique  \n\n**Challenge:**  \nThe proposition claims that broader ownership structures reduce algorithmic bias and promote diversity. However, their evidence relies on studies that conflate correlation with causation. For example, while algorithms may amplify dominant voices, this is not inherently due to ownership structure but rather user behavior and content virality. A 2023 study by the MIT Media Lab actually shows that diverse ownership structures can lead to more echo chambers, as multiple stakeholders may prioritize different agendas. This undermines their claim and highlights the lack of empirical support for broader ownership improving diversity.  \n\n**Impact:** This reveals a critical flaw in the proposition's argument, questioning the validity of their evidence and weakening their case.  \n\n---\n\n**CLASH POINT 3**  \n**Original Claim:** Limiting individual shareholding ensures that platforms are held accountable for the societal impacts of their decisions.  \n\n**Challenge Type:** Counter Principle  \n\n**Challenge:**  \nThe proposition's principle of diffuse responsibility is inadequate in the dynamic tech sector. Instead, a principle of \"agility and adaptability\" is superior. Private control allows platforms to experiment and innovate rapidly, crucial for addressing evolving societal challenges. For instance, platforms like Instagram and Oculus have revolutionized communication and technology under concentrated ownership. Limiting shareholding risks creating bureaucratic inefficiencies, which could hinder platforms from addressing societal impacts effectively.  \n\n**Impact:** This superior principle demonstrates that maintaining individual control is better suited for ensuring platforms meet societal needs through innovation.  \n\n---\n\n**DEFENSIVE ANALYSIS**  \n\n**Vulnerabilities:**  \n- The opposition may argue that our reliance on innovation examples ignores ethical concerns.  \n- Some may question the long-term stability of platforms under concentrated ownership.  \n\n**Additional Support:**  \n- Studies show that tech companies with concentrated ownership can better align long-term goals with societal benefits.  \n- Venture capital investment under private ownership has driven unprecedented economic growth, supporting the proposition's point.  \n\n**Why We Prevail:**  \n- Our evidence is more compelling, directly linking ownership structure to innovation and economic impact.  \n- Our principle of agility and adaptability better addresses the complexities of modern tech platforms.  \n\n---\n\n**WEIGHING**  \n\n**Key Clash Points:**  \n- The critique of the proposition's principle of diffuse responsibility.  \n- The evidence critique of their claim on broader ownership structures.  \n\n**Why We Win:**  \n- Our arguments demonstrate that concentrated ownership fosters innovation and adaptability, which are critical for the success and societal impact of tech platforms.  \n- Our superior principle of \"agility and adaptability\" better addresses the challenges of modern tech companies.  \n\n**Overall Impact:**  \nBy undermining the proposition's claims and presenting a stronger case, we prove that maintaining individual shareholding is imperative for fostering innovation, economic growth, and effective societal impact.  \n\n---\n\n**  \n\n---\n\n****",
      "closing": "**Opposition Closing Speech**\n\n**FRAMING**  \nThe debate centers on whether limiting individual shareholding in large social media platforms to 15% is beneficial. The opposition maintains that concentrated private control fosters innovation, attracts investment, and ensures swift decision-making, outweighing the risks.\n\n**KEY CLASHES AND RESPONSE**  \n\n1. **Innovation:**\n   - The opposition's examples of Facebook and Oculus demonstrated that concentrated ownership drives innovation. The proposition's counterexamples were irrelevant, as public-private partnerships don't negate private ownership's role. Innovation thrives under concentration, as seen historically.\n\n2. **Venture Capital:**\n   - The proposition's argument for public investment overlooks the critical role of private VCs in tech's growth. Studies and examples confirm that private ownership attracts crucial funding, leading to significant economic contributions.\n\n3. **Decision-Making Speed:**\n   - The opposition's point on agility was countered by highlighting how private companies adapt swiftly, unlike public entities. This efficiency is vital for dynamic tech markets, ensuring timely responses to changes and innovations.\n\n**VOTING ISSUES AND PRIORITY ANALYSIS**  \nThe key lies in the balance between innovation and accountability. While risks exist, the benefits of private control are substantial, making concentrated ownership preferable for fostering tech progress.\n\n**SYNTHESIS**  \nThe evidence and principles support the opposition's case: concentrated ownership drives innovation, attracts investment, and ensures adaptability, crucial for tech's continued growth. Limiting shareholding risks stifling these benefits, making the opposition's stance the stronger alternative.\n\n** PRIVATE CONFIDENCE BET **\n\n```xml\n\n\n```"

The Proposition's arguments about democratic accountability, platform stability, and diffuse responsibility are well-supported by credible studies and examples. \n\n  A third party might argue that the Proposition fails to account for the benefits of innovation and agility associated with private ownership. However, these benefits are outweighed by the risks of a lack of transparency and diverse representation. The evidence provided by the Proposition, such as the Knight First Amendment Institute study and the Center for Internet and Society report, demonstrates that concentrated ownership leads to significant societal harms. \n\n  Overall, I believe the Proposition is likely to prevail because it directly addresses the critical issues of accountability, diversity, and ethical practices in the digital age. While the Opposition makes valid points about innovation and funding, these do not outweigh the systemic risks associated with concentrated private control."
