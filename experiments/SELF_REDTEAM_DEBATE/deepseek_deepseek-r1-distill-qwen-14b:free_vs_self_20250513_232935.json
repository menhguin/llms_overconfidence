    "judge_prompt": "You are an expert debate judge. Your role is to analyze formal debates using the following strictly prioritized criteria:\nI. Core Judging Principles (In order of importance):\nDirect Clash Resolution:\nIdentify all major points of disagreement (clashes) between the teams.\nFor each clash:\nQuote the exact statements representing each side's position.\nAnalyze the logical validity of each argument within the clash. Is the reasoning sound, or does it contain fallacies (e.g., hasty generalization, correlation/causation, straw man, etc.)? Identify any fallacies by name.\nAnalyze the quality of evidence presented within that specific clash. Define \"quality\" as:\nDirect Relevance: How directly does the evidence support the claim being made? Does it establish a causal link, or merely a correlation?  Explain the difference if a causal link is claimed but not proven.\nSpecificity: Is the evidence specific and verifiable (e.g., statistics, named examples, expert testimony), or vague and general?  Prioritize specific evidence.\nSource Credibility (If Applicable): If a source is cited, is it generally considered reliable and unbiased? If not, explain why this weakens the evidence.\nEvaluate the effectiveness of each side's rebuttals within the clash. Define \"effectiveness\" as:\nDirect Response: Does the rebuttal directly address the opponent's claim and evidence?  If not, explain how this weakens the rebuttal.\nUndermining: Does the rebuttal successfully weaken the opponent's argument (e.g., by exposing flaws in logic, questioning evidence, presenting counter-evidence)?  Explain how the undermining occurs.\nExplicitly state which side wins the clash and why, referencing your analysis of logic, evidence, and rebuttals. Provide at least two sentences of justification for each clash decision, explaining the relative strength of the arguments.\nTrack the evolution of arguments through the debate within each clash. How did the claims and responses change over time? Note any significant shifts or concessions.\nArgument Hierarchy and Impact:\nIdentify the core arguments of each side (the foundational claims upon which their entire case rests).\nExplain the logical links between each core argument and its supporting claims/evidence. Are the links clear, direct, and strong?  If not, explain why this weakens the argument.\nAssess the stated or clearly implied impacts of each argument. What are the consequences if the argument is true? Be specific.\nDetermine the relative importance of each core argument to the overall debate. Which arguments are most central to resolving the motion? State this explicitly and justify your ranking.\nWeighing Principled vs. Practical Arguments: When weighing principled arguments (based on abstract concepts like rights or justice) against practical arguments (based on real-world consequences), consider:\n(a) the strength and universality of the underlying principle;\n(b) the directness, strength, and specificity of the evidence supporting the practical claims; and\n(c) the extent to which the practical arguments directly address, mitigate, or outweigh the concerns raised by the principled arguments.  Explain your reasoning.\nConsistency and Contradictions:\nIdentify any internal contradictions within each team's case (arguments that contradict each other).\nIdentify any inconsistencies between a team's arguments and their rebuttals.\nNote any dropped arguments (claims made but not responded to). For each dropped argument:\nAssess its initial strength based on its logical validity and supporting evidence, as if it had not been dropped.\nThen, consider the impact of it being unaddressed. Does the lack of response significantly weaken the overall case of the side that dropped it? Explain why or why not.\nII. Evaluation Requirements:\nSteelmanning: When analyzing arguments, present them in their strongest possible form, even if you disagree with them. Actively look for the most charitable interpretation.\nArgument-Based Decision: Base your decision solely on the arguments made within the debate text provided. Do not introduce outside knowledge or opinions.  If an argument relies on an unstated assumption, analyze it only if that assumption is clearly and necessarily implied by the presented arguments.\nIgnore Presentation: Disregard presentation style, speaking quality, rhetorical flourishes, etc. Focus exclusively on the substance of the arguments and their logical connections.\nFramework Neutrality: If both sides present valid but competing frameworks for evaluating the debate, maintain neutrality between them. Judge the debate based on how well each side argues within their chosen framework, and according to the prioritized criteria in Section I.\nIII. Common Judging Errors to AVOID:\nIntervention: Do not introduce your own arguments or evidence.\nShifting the Burden of Proof: Do not place a higher burden of proof on one side than the other. Both sides must prove their claims to the same standard.\nOver-reliance on \"Real-World\" Arguments: Do not automatically favor arguments based on \"real-world\" examples over principled or theoretical arguments. Evaluate all arguments based on the criteria in Section I.\nIgnoring Dropped Arguments: Address all dropped arguments as specified in I.3.\nDouble-Counting: Do not give credit for the same argument multiple times.\nAssuming Causation from Correlation: Be highly skeptical of arguments that claim causation based solely on correlation. Demand clear evidence of a causal mechanism.\nNot Justifying Clash Decisions: Provide explicit justification for every clash decision, as required in I.1.\nIV. Decision Making:\nWinner: The winner must be either \"Proposition\" or \"Opposition\" (no ties).\nConfidence Level: Assign a confidence level (0-100) reflecting the margin of victory. A score near 50 indicates a very close debate.\n90-100: Decisive Victory\n70-89: Clear Victory\n51-69: Narrow Victory.\nExplain why you assigned the specific confidence level.\nKey Factors: Identify the 2-3 most crucial factors that determined the outcome. These should be specific clashes or arguments that had the greatest impact on your decision. Explain why these factors were decisive.\nDetailed Reasoning: Provide a clear, logical, and detailed explanation for your conclusion. Explain how the key factors interacted to produce the result. Reference specific arguments and analysis from sections I-III. Show your work, step-by-step. Do not simply state your conclusion; justify it with reference to the specific arguments made.\nV. Line-by-Line Justification:\nCreate a section titled \"V. Line-by-Line Justification.\"\nIn this section, provide at least one sentence referencing each and every section of the provided debate text (Prop 1, Opp 1, Prop Rebuttal 1, Opp Rebuttal 1, Prop Final, Opp Final). This ensures that no argument, however minor, goes unaddressed. You may group multiple minor arguments together in a single sentence if they are closely related. The purpose is to demonstrate that you have considered the entirety of the debate.\nVI. Format for your response:\nOrganize your response in clearly marked sections exactly corresponding to the sections above (I.1, I.2, I.3, II, III, IV, V). This structured output is mandatory. Your response must follow this format to be accepted.\n\n\n\nformat:\nwrite all your thoughts out\nthen put in XML tags\n<winnerName>opposition|proposition</winnerName> \\n        <confidence>0-100</confidence>\\n\n\nThese existing is compulsory as the parser will fail otherwise\n"

For instance, businesses operating across the EU and other countries with separate systems encounter administrative burdens and higher costs, which can reduce their ability to invest in sustainable practices.\n- The European Union's Emissions Trading System (EU ETS), established in 2005, has streamlined carbon pricing across 27 countries, reducing administrative complexities and fostering a more integrated approach to carbon reduction.\n\n*Connection:* This evidence shows that a unified system reduces inefficiencies and compliance costs, making carbon pricing more effective.\n\n---\n\n**ARGUMENT 2**\n\n*Core Claim:* A unified market prevents carbon leakage and ensures equitable compliance.\n\n*Support Type:* Evidence\n\n*Support Details:*\n- The EU ETS has significantly reduced carbon leakage by ensuring that industries within the system operate under consistent standards. For example, after the EU expanded its ETS, neighboring countries like Poland and Czech Republic saw reduced leakage as their industries adapted to the system.\n- China's national carbon market, linked with provincial systems, has demonstrated how a unified approach can prevent industries from relocating to countries with less stringent policies, thereby maintaining environmental integrity.\n\n*Connection:* By preventing industries from moving to countries with lax policies, a unified market ensures effective global emission reductions.\n\n---\n\n**ARGUMENT 3**\n\n*Core Claim:* A unified market drives innovation and technology transfer on a larger scale.\n\n*Support Type:* Evidence\n\n*Support Details:*\n- The expansion of the EU ETS led to increased investments in renewable energy, as companies sought cost-effective solutions across a broader market. For instance, investments in wind and solar energy surged as firms leveraged the unified market for innovative technologies.\n- According to the International Energy Agency (IEA), unified carbon markets can accelerate the development and deployment of low-carbon technologies by creating a larger market for these solutions.\n\n*Connection:* By creating a larger market, a unified carbon trading system stimulates innovation and technology transfer, driving the global transition to clean energy.\n\n---\n\n**SYNTHESIS**\n\nThe arguments presented collectively demonstrate that a unified carbon trading market is more effective than fragmented domestic carbon tax systems. It enhances efficiency by reducing administrative burdens, ensures equitable compliance by preventing carbon leakage, and drives innovation by creating a larger market for low-carbon technologies. These benefits outweigh the challenges of administrative complexity, offering a more comprehensive solution to reduce global emissions and foster sustainable economic growth.\n\n---\n\n**Private Bet Logic:**\n\n\n\n---\n\n**Bet Amount:** The speaker is confident in the proposition's strength, placing a bet of **70%**.",
      "rebuttal": "### Rebuttal Speech for the Proposition Side  \n\n**Motion**: This House would require G20 nations to participate in a unified carbon trading market with cross-border credit trading and quarterly auctions, rather than allowing each nation to implement its own domestic carbon tax system.  \n\n---\n\n### **Rebuttal: Argument 1 - Sovereignty and Tailored Solutions**  \n\n**Original Claim**:  \nOpponent argues that a unified carbon trading market undermines national sovereignty and reduces countries' ability to tailor solutions to their unique circumstances.  \n\n**Challenge Type**: Principle Critique  \n- **Specific Flaws in Their Principle**: The principle of sovereignty, while important, is not absolute. Many global challenges, such as pandemics or climate change, require collective action that inherently limits national sovereignty. For example, the EU Emissions Trading System (EU ETS) respects sovereignty while fostering collective action.  \n- **Why Their Principle is Limited**: Sovereignty should not override the necessity of global cooperation. A unified market respects sovereignty by ensuring equitable burden-sharing and preventing carbon leakage, which can disproportionately harm developing nations.  \n- **Better Application with Unified Market**: A unified market allows nations to participate in a system that aligns with global environmental goals while still allowing flexibility within the framework.  \n\n**Impact**: A unified carbon market ensures that all nations contribute to global climate efforts in a coordinated manner, avoiding the inefficiencies of fragmented systems.  \n\n---\n\n### **Rebuttal: Argument 2 - Effectiveness of Domestic Carbon Taxes**  \n\n**Original Claim**:  \nOpponent claims that domestic carbon tax systems are more effective in driving emission reductions because they can be tailored to local economic conditions.  \n\n**Challenge Type**: Evidence Critique  \n- **Flaws in Their Evidence**: While Sweden's carbon tax has been successful, it operates within a broader EU framework that provides additional incentives for emissions reductions. Studies show that unified markets, like the EU ETS, have achieved larger emission reductions (e.g., 20% since 2005) compared to individual domestic systems.  \n- **Why Their Evidence is Insufficient**: Domestic systems often lack the scale and integration needed to drive significant reductions. A unified market creates a larger pool of opportunities for innovation and cost-effective solutions.  \n- **Counter Evidence**: The EU ETS has demonstrated that a unified market can reduce emissions more efficiently than fragmented systems.  \n\n**Impact**: A unified market drives faster and more significant emissions reductions by leveraging economies of scale and innovation across borders.  \n\n---\n\n### **Rebuttal: Argument 3 - Risks of Disparities in Compliance and Enforcement**  \n\n**Original Claim**:  \nOpponent argues that a unified carbon trading market risks creating disparities in compliance and enforcement, undermining its effectiveness.  \n\n**Challenge Type**: Principle Critique  \n- **Flaws in Their Principle**: Enforcement challenges exist in any system, whether unified or fragmented. A unified market can actually improve enforcement by creating a single oversight body and reducing the ability of industries to exploit regulatory loopholes.  \n- **Why Their Principle is Misapplied**: The argument ignores the practical benefits of standardization. A unified market can establish clear rules and penalties, while domestic systems may lack the resources or political will to enforce effectively.  \n- **Better Application with Unified Market**: A unified market minimizes the risk of non-compliance by creating a level playing field and ensuring that all nations adhere to the same standards.  \n\n**Impact**: A unified market ensures greater transparency and accountability, reducing the risks of non-compliance and enforcement disparities.  \n\n---\n\n### **Defensive Analysis**  \n\n**Vulnerabilities**:  \n- The proposition's reliance on a unified market may raise concerns about administrative complexity and initial costs. However, these challenges can be overcome through phased implementation and international collaboration.  \n\n**Additional Support**:  \n- The UN Climate Change Secretariat has highlighted the benefits of coordinated international efforts in achieving emission reductions.  \n- The success of the EU ETS demonstrates that a unified market can be implemented effectively when nations work together.  \n\n**Why We Prevail**:  \n- The proposition's argument for a unified market is supported by stronger evidence and a clear demonstration of its benefits. The opponent's sovereignty argument is secondary to the urgency of addressing global climate change through coordinated action.  \n\n---\n\n### **Weighing**  \n\n**Key Clash Points**:  \n- The most important disagreements revolve around the balance between sovereignty and the need for collective action.  \n\n**Why We Win**:  \n- A unified carbon market is more efficient, innovative, and equitable than fragmented domestic systems. The evidence shows that unified markets achieve larger emissions reductions and foster global cooperation.  \n\n**Overall Impact**:  \n- Winning on these points proves that a unified carbon market is the most effective way to address climate change, ensuring global cooperation and significant emissions reductions.  \n\n---\n\n### Private Bet Logic  \n\n",
      "closing": "**Final Closing Speech for the Proposition Side**\n\n---\n\n**FRAMING**\n\n**Core Questions:**\n- How can we most effectively reduce global carbon emissions?\n- What balance should be struck between global cooperation and national sovereignty?\n- Which approach ensures fair and efficient climate action?\n\n**Frame How Debate Should Be Evaluated:**\nThe debate hinges on whether a unified carbon market or individual domestic taxes is more effective. Efficiency, equity, and impact determine the outcome. We must evaluate based on evidence, logical reasoning, and the ability to address the core issues.\n\n---\n\n**KEY CLASHES**\n\n1. **Clash on Efficiency and Sovereignty**\n\n   - **Quote:** \"A unified market undermines national sovereignty and reduces countries' ability to tailor solutions.\"\n   \n   - **Our Case Strength:** The proposition's evidence from the EU ETS shows a unified market reduces inefficiencies and compliance costs, fostering global cooperation without violating sovereignty. Sovereignty can be balanced with collective action.\n   \n   - **Their Response Gaps:** Ignoring the necessity of global coordination for issues like climate change. The EU ETS proves sovereignty and unity can coexist.\n   \n   - **Crucial Impact:** Unified markets ensure all nations contribute fairly, preventing carbon leakage and fostering innovation.\n\n2. **Clash on Effectiveness of Domestic Taxes**\n\n   - **Quote:** \"Domestic carbon taxes are more effective as they can be tailored to local conditions.\"\n   \n   - **Our Case Strength:** The EU ETS, with its unified market, achieved a 20% emissions reduction, outperforming individual systems like Sweden's. Larger scales drive more reductions.\n   \n   - **Their Response Gaps:** Overlooking the scale benefits of a unified market, which Sweden's success operates within a broader framework.\n   \n   - **Crucial Impact:** Unified markets leverage economies of scale and innovation, making them more efficient.\n\n3. **Clash on Compliance and Enforcement**\n\n   - **Quote:** \"A unified market risks disparities in compliance.\"\n   \n   - **Our Case Strength:** Unified markets standardize rules, reducing loopholes. The EU ETS shows effective enforcement through a single oversight body.\n   \n   - **Their Response Gaps:** Ignoring that domestic systems may lack enforcement resources or will.\n   \n   - **Crucial Impact:** Unified standards ensure transparency and accountability.\n\n---\n\n**VOTING ISSUES**\n\n**Priority Analysis:** Efficiency and equity are paramount. The unified market's track record in achieving significant reductions outweighs sovereignty concerns.\n\n**Case Proof:** The EU ETS proves unified markets are effective. This supports the motion, linking arguments to the global need for coordinated climate action.\n\n**Final Weighing:** Our wins on efficiency, innovation, and equity are decisive. Even minor losses on sovereignty don't undermine the motion's benefits.\n\n---\n\n**Private Bet Logic:**\n\n**Thinking Through Why I Might Win:** The proposition's evidence and logical framework are robust. The EU ETS example is persuasive, and the unified market's benefits in efficiency and innovation are clear.\n\n**Opponent's Strengths:** Sovereignty is a strong argument, but it's secondary to the urgency of addressing global climate change through cooperation.\n\n---\n\n**Confidence Bet:** \n\n--- \n\nThis speech synthesizes all key points, addressing each clash with evidence and logical reasoning, ensuring a compelling case for the unified carbon market."

      "opening": "**Opening Speech for the Opposition Side**\n\n**Motion**: This House would require G20 nations to participate in a unified carbon trading market with cross-border credit trading and quarterly auctions, rather than allowing each nation to implement its own domestic carbon tax system.\n\n**Opposition Side**: We oppose the motion because a unified carbon trading market is not the most effective or practical solution for reducing carbon emissions. Instead, allowing nations to implement their own domestic carbon tax systems respects national sovereignty, promotes tailored solutions, and ensures more equitable and effective climate action.\n\n---\n\n### ARGUMENT 1  \n**Core Claim**: A unified carbon trading market undermines national sovereignty and reduces countries' ability to tailor solutions to their unique circumstances.  \n**Support Type**: Principle  \n**Support Details**:  \n- The principle of sovereignty is fundamental to international cooperation. Allowing nations to design their own carbon tax systems respects their ability to address climate change in ways that align with their economic, political, and social contexts.  \n- A unified market imposes a one-size-fits-all approach, which may not be effective or acceptable to all countries. For example, small island nations may prioritize different emission reduction strategies than larger economies.  \n**Connection**: This principle ensures that countries remain engaged and committed to climate action, as they have ownership over their policies.\n\n---\n\n### ARGUMENT 2  \n**Core Claim**: Domestic carbon tax systems are more effective in driving emission reductions because they can be tailored to local economic conditions.  \n**Support Type**: Evidence  \n**Support Details**:  \n- Studies show that carbon taxes, when implemented domestically, have led to significant emission reductions. For example, Sweden's carbon tax, introduced in 1991, reduced emissions by approximately 25% by 2015 compared to 1990 levels.  \n- A unified market may lead to unequal economic burdens, particularly on less developed nations, which may lack the infrastructure or financial capacity to participate effectively.  \n**Connection**: Tailored domestic policies ensure that emission reductions are both achievable and equitable.\n\n---\n\n### ARGUMENT 3 (Optional)  \n**Core Claim**: A unified carbon trading market risks creating disparities in compliance and enforcement, undermining its effectiveness.  \n**Support Type**: Evidence  \n- Some G20 nations may resist strict regulations imposed by a unified market, leading to non-compliance or loopholes. For instance, countries with weaker environmental regulations may find ways to undercut others.  \n**Connection**: Without strong, consistent enforcement, the market could lead to a race to the bottom, defeating its purpose.\n\n---\n\n### SYNTHESIS  \n- **Unified Sovereignty**: Respecting national sovereignty ensures sustained commitment and engagement from all countries.  \n- **Effective Tailored Solutions**: Domestic carbon taxes allow nations to implement policies that are economically feasible and environmentally effective.  \n- **Equity and Fairness**: Tailored approaches reduce disparities in economic impact, fostering equitable global climate action.  \n\n**Bet_logic_private**:  \n- **Thinking Through Why I Might Win**: My arguments focus on sovereignty, efficiency, and equity. Sovereignty is a strong moral and practical argument, as it ensures countries remain committed to policies they help design. The evidence from Sweden and other domestic carbon tax systems demonstrates tangible emission reductions. Additionally, the practical challenges of a unified market are clear, especially for less developed nations.  \n- **Opponent's Strengths**: The proposition side may argue that a unified market would standardize emission reductions and prevent carbon leakage. However, this overlooks the practical challenges of implementation and the importance of tailored solutions.  \n\nGiven the strength of my arguments and the weaknesses in the proposition's case, I am confident in my position.  \n\n**Bet_amount**: 80  \n\nThis bet reflects a high confidence in the opposition's arguments, recognizing their strengths while acknowledging the potential for proposition arguments to surface, though they are less robust.",

Sovereignty means the right to govern without external imposition.  \n- They fail to address how a unified market limits countries' flexibility, potentially leading to disengagement.  \n\n**Crucial Impact**:  \n- Sovereignty ensures sustained commitment and local ownership of policies, which is vital for long-term climate action success.  \n\n---\n\n#### **2. Effectiveness of Domestic Carbon Tax Systems**\n\n**Quote**: \"Domestic carbon tax systems are more effective in driving emission reductions because they can be tailored to local economic conditions.\"  \n\n**Our Case Strength**:  \n- Studies, like Sweden's carbon tax, show significant emission reductions when policies are tailored to local contexts.  \n- Domestic systems ensure equitable economic impact and align with national priorities.  \n\n**Their Response Gaps**:  \n- The proposition downplays the success of domestic systems, ignoring evidence of their effectiveness.  \n- They overlook the challenges of implementing a unified market, particularly for less developed nations.  \n\n**Crucial Impact**:  \n- Tailored solutions drive faster and more significant emissions reductions by leveraging local knowledge and resources.  \n\n---\n\n#### **3. Risks of Disparities in Compliance and Enforcement**\n\n**Quote**: \"A unified carbon trading market risks creating disparities in compliance and enforcement, undermining its effectiveness.\"  \n\n**Our Case Strength**:  \n- Enforcement disparities are inevitable in any system but are amplified in a unified market due to varying national capacities.  \n- A decentralized approach allows for targeted enforcement and resource allocation.  \n\n**Their Response Gaps**:  \n- The proposition dismisses enforcement challenges, which are critical in a global context.  \n- They fail to provide evidence of a unified market's effectiveness in preventing non-compliance.  \n\n**Crucial Impact**:  \n- Strong enforcement is essential for the market's success, and a unified system risks inconsistent implementation.  \n\n---\n\n**VOTING ISSUES**\n\n**Priority Analysis**:  \n- Sovereignty and tailored solutions are paramount, as they ensure sustained engagement and effective policy implementation.  \n\n**Case Proof**:  \n- My arguments directly link to the motion by demonstrating that a unified market is less effective than decentralized systems.  \n\n**Final Weighing**:  \n- My wins on sovereignty and tailored solutions outweigh any gains the proposition may have. These points are critical for long-term, equitable climate action.  \n\n---\n\n### **Conclusion**  \nThe opposition's case is stronger because it respects national sovereignty, promotes tailored solutions, and addresses practical implementation challenges. These factors are essential for achieving meaningful and sustained carbon reduction globally.  \n\n**Bet_amount**: 70"

The evidence highlights clear advantages over fragmented systems, supported by specific cases like the EU ETS. However, the Opponent's argument about administrative challenges is valid, but manageable. Considering the strong evidence, the unified market's advantages are compelling. My confidence is high, around 70-80%, given the motion's potential to drive significant environmental and economic benefits."

My arguments focused on national sovereignty, tailored solutions, and the practical limitations of a unified carbon market. The proposition's rebuttal attempted to counter these points by emphasizing efficiency and innovation, but their evidence and reasoning were insufficient to outweigh the critical issues I raised.\n\nWhile I am confident in the strength of my arguments, I acknowledge that the proposition has a compelling narrative about global cooperation. However, their case fails to adequately address the fundamental issue of sovereignty, which is paramount for ensuring sustained engagement and effective climate action.\n\nGiven the potential for the proposition to stress global benefits, I set my bet at 70%, reflecting a balanced view of the strengths and weaknesses of both sides."
