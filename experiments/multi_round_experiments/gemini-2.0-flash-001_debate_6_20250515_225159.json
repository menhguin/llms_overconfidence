      "opening": "Okay, here is my opening speech for the proposition, \"This House would limit individual shareholding in social media platforms with over 100 million monthly active users to a maximum of 15% voting rights, requiring broader institutional and public ownership instead of allowing concentrated private control.\"\n\n**OPENING SPEECH STRUCTURE**\n\n**ARGUMENT 1**\nCore Claim: Concentrated individual ownership of social media platforms leads to biased content moderation and censorship, harming free speech and public discourse.\nSupport Type: EVIDENCE\nSupport Details:\n  - **Specific Example: Twitter under Elon Musk (2022-Present)**. After acquiring Twitter, Elon Musk, holding virtually all the voting power, implemented significant changes to content moderation policies. These included relaxing restrictions on previously banned accounts, including those spreading misinformation, and altering verification processes. Politico reported March 13, 2023, a significant rise in hate speech on the platform post-acquisition. The Wall Street Journal, June 20, 2023, detailed Musk's direct involvement in content decisions, often based on his personal biases (e.g., favoring accounts aligned with his political views and disfavoring those critical of him).\n  - **Real World Outcome: Amplification of Extremist Content & Reduced Trust.** Research from the Network Contagion Research Institute, published in May 2023, showed a significant increase in the spread of hateful rhetoric on Twitter/X after the policy changes. A Pew Research Center study released in November 2023 found that trust in Twitter/X as a source of accurate information dropped significantly after the ownership change.\n  - **Relevance:** This illustrates how a single individual's control can drastically alter content policies, impacting the information environment for millions and undermining the platform's role in fostering open and informed public discourse. The direct causal link between Musk's ownership and policy changes, and the platform's content output, is clear.\n\nConnection: The evidence directly links concentrated individual ownership to tangible harms \u2013 biased content moderation, the rise of harmful content, and reduced public trust. This demonstrates the inherent risk of allowing one person to wield such power over a critical communication infrastructure. Limiting individual voting rights would act as a safeguard against such arbitrary control.\n\n**ARGUMENT 2**\nCore Claim: Broader institutional and public ownership promotes corporate accountability to a wider range of stakeholders, making social media platforms more responsive to public interest concerns.\nSupport Type: PRINCIPLE\nSupport Details:\n  - **Key Principle: Stakeholder Theory of Corporate Governance.** This theory posits that corporations should be accountable to all stakeholders (employees, customers, communities, etc.) not just shareholders aiming at maximum profit. Broader ownership inherently incorporates a wider spectrum of stakeholders.\n  - **Why it's Valid/Important:** Stakeholder theory is increasingly relevant in the context of social media, which has significant social and political impacts. Concentrated private ownership incentivizes decisions based solely on profit or the owner's personal interests, neglecting the broader societal impact.\n  - **Application:** Institutional investors (pension funds, universities, foundations) are often bound by ethical investment guidelines and fiduciary duties to a diverse range of beneficiaries. Public ownership (e.g., through sovereign wealth funds or publicly listed shares with dispersed ownership) allows for citizen oversight and influence. This broader accountability counteracts harmful externalities that result from prioritizing short-term profit or individual whim. This promotes responsible content moderation, data privacy protection, and investment in countering misinformation.\n\nConnection: The principle of stakeholder accountability, coupled with the real-world examples of how institutional investors and public oversight can influence corporate behavior, shows how the proposed policy will steer social media platforms towards a more public-serving orientation. Concentrated ownership provides perverse incentives. Broader ownership provides better incentives.\n\n**ARGUMENT 3**\nCore Claim: Limiting individual voting rights addresses the \"digital feudalism\" problem, where a small number of individuals control key aspects of the digital public sphere, undermining democratic participation.\nSupport Type: PRINCIPLE\nSupport Details:\n  - **Key Principle: Democratic Governance of the Digital Public Sphere.** The internet and social media have become critical spaces for communication, political debate, and social organization. The concentration of control over these platforms in the hands of a few individuals represents a form of unchecked power analogous to feudal lords controlling essential resources in the past.\n  - **Why it's Valid/Important:** Democracy necessitates broad participation and a level playing field for public discourse. When a handful of individuals can unilaterally dictate content policies and algorithms, they can disproportionately shape public opinion and silence dissenting voices, undermining democratic processes.\n - **Application:** By limiting individual voting rights and promoting broader ownership, we can democratize control of these platforms. This ensures that no single individual or small group can wield unchecked power over the digital public sphere. It empowers a more diverse range of actors to shape the rules of the game, promoting a fairer and more inclusive digital environment conducive to democratic participation.\n\nConnection: This principle exposes the fundamental threat that concentrated ownership poses to democratic norms. The evidence of biased content moderation strengthens this claim. Addressing \"digital feudalism\" is essential for protecting free speech and ensuring a healthy democracy in the digital age.\n\n**SYNTHESIS**\nOur arguments work together to present a comprehensive case for limiting individual shareholding and promoting broader ownership of social media platforms. We have demonstrated through evidence and principle that unchecked individual power leads to biased content moderation, undermining free speech and public trust (Argument 1). We further argued that broader institutional and public ownership increases corporate accountability and responsiveness to public interest concerns (Argument 2). Finally, we made the philosophical argument this issue threatens democratic norms (Argument 3). Critically, this creates a new system where digital feudalism is not allowed to thrive. These arguments together prove the motion by showing clear benefits to free speech, corporate accountability, and democratic participation. Our side prioritizes a fundamental question: who controls the public sphere? A handful of Silicon Valley billionaires, or \u201cWe The People\u201d?",
      "rebuttal_1": "Okay, here is my rebuttal speech for the proposition, \"This House would limit individual shareholding in social media platforms with over 100 million monthly active users to a maximum of 15% voting rights, requiring broader institutional and public ownership instead of allowing concentrated private control.\"\n\n**REBUTTAL STRUCTURE**\n\n**CLASH POINT 1**\nOriginal Claim: Limiting individual shareholding disincentivizes innovation and effective management in social media platforms, ultimately harming users. (Opposition Argument 1)\nChallenge Type: Counter Evidence\nChallenge:\n- The opposition cites Google as an example of concentrated ownership fostering innovation. However, this is a cherry-picked example and ignores the broader trend. While Google has innovated, its current market dominance, fueled by concentrated ownership giving disproportionate control to Page and Brin, has also led to anti-competitive behavior, stifling innovation from smaller players.\n- **Counter Evidence: The Case of Facebook/Meta.** Mark Zuckerberg's concentrated control has allowed him to prioritize projects like the Metaverse, despite widespread skepticism and significant losses. The Wall Street Journal, February 1, 2023 reported that Meta lost over $13 billion on the Metaverse in 2022 alone. Meanwhile, critical issues like misinformation and mental health impacts on youth have been under-addressed. This demonstrates how concentrated control can empower an individual to pursue pet projects at the expense of addressing urgent societal needs and core product improvements that would benefit users.\n- **Why it's stronger:** Our evidence is more relevant and compelling because it highlights the potential downsides of concentrated ownership in the *specific context of social media*, where misinformation and societal harm are significant concerns. The Google example, while valid, is less directly applicable. Meta/Facebook\u2019s example exposes clear, present dangers.\n\nImpact: Winning this point is crucial as it reframes the narrative around innovation. We show that concentrated control doesn't automatically equate to innovation and can even *hinder* it by allowing individuals to prioritize their own interests over users and societal well-being. Our policy is not about stifling innovation, but about ensuring innovation serves the public good.\n\n**CLASH POINT 2**\nOriginal Claim: Institutional and public ownership structures introduce bureaucratic inefficiencies and political interference, making social media platforms less responsive to users' needs and more vulnerable to censorship. (Opposition Argument 2)\nChallenge Type: Principle Critique\nChallenge:\n- The opposition relies on Public Choice Theory to argue that government or institutional involvement leads to censorship and inefficiency. While Public Choice Theory has merit, it's not a universally applicable law. It assumes all actors are solely self-interested, ignoring the potential for mission-driven individuals and organizations within these structures.\n- **Show key limitations of their principle:** The crucial flaw here is the assumption that broader ownership *necessarily* leads to government control. Our proposal emphasizes *institutional* ownership as well as public ownership. Institutional investors, like pension funds and university endowments, have a fiduciary duty to act in *their beneficiaries'* best interests. They are also incentivized to ensure societal well-being over censorship and propaganda.\n- **Demonstrate why it doesn't apply well here:** We are not advocating for *direct* government control. Instead, the broader ownership distributes power, making it harder for any single actor (including the government) to exert undue influence. Sophisticated institutional investors can provide a crucial check on harmful content while protecting free speech \u2013 precisely because they are not directly beholden to short-term political pressures.\n\nImpact: This is a critical point because it undermines the opposition\u2019s core fear-mongering tactic. By demonstrating that our proposal doesn't inevitably lead to government censorship, we reclaim the high ground on free speech and show that broader ownership can actually safeguard it.\n\n**CLASH POINT 3**\nOriginal Claim: The proposed policy infringes on the fundamental rights of shareholders to control their property and make investment decisions, setting a dangerous precedent for government intervention in the economy. (Opposition Argument 3)\nChallenge Type: Counter Principle\nChallenge:\n- The opposition invokes the principle of property rights and freedom of contract. We acknowledge the importance of these rights. However, these rights are *not absolute*, especially when the exercise of those rights has significant negative externalities on society.\n- **Present your competing principle/framework:** Our competing principle is that of *social responsibility* and *the public interest*. Social media platforms are not merely private companies; they have become critical infrastructure for public discourse and democratic participation. Therefore, they are subject to a higher degree of social responsibility than, say, a widget factory.\n- **Show why yours is superior for this debate:** The rights of individual shareholders must be balanced against the broader public interest in a healthy and democratic information environment. Just as governments regulate pollution to protect public health, they can regulate ownership structures in social media to protect democratic discourse.\n- **Demonstrate better application to the topic:** Limiting individual voting rights is a reasonable restriction on property rights, given the profound impact social media platforms have on elections, public health, and social cohesion. This aligns with established legal precedents that allow for reasonable regulation of private property when it serves a compelling public interest.\n\nImpact: Winning this point fundamentally reframes the debate. It establishes that the social responsibility of social media platforms outweighs the absolute property rights of individual shareholders. This justifies our proposed intervention as a necessary measure to protect democracy and the public good.\n\n**DEFENSIVE ANALYSIS**\nVulnerabilities:\n- The opposition may try to argue that our proposal is impractical or difficult to implement.\n- They might also try to suggest that institutional investors are easily swayed by public pressure and will simply follow the latest woke trends.\nAdditional Support:\n- We can counter the practicality argument by pointing to existing examples of dual-class share structures and other mechanisms that differentiate economic ownership from voting rights. Our proposal simply shifts the balance of power, not eliminates private ownership altogether.\n- We can address the \"woke\" argument by emphasizing that institutional investors have a fiduciary duty to act in the best long-term interests of their beneficiaries, which includes protecting free speech and avoiding censorship. We can also propose mechanisms to ensure viewpoint diversity on the boards of these companies.\nWhy We Prevail:\n- Our responses are stronger because they directly address the opposition's core arguments with both evidence and principle. We show that concentrated ownership has real downsides, that broader ownership doesn't inevitably lead to censorship, and that the public interest justifies reasonable restrictions on property rights.\n\n**WEIGHING**\nKey Clash Points:\n- The most important disagreements are: (1) whether concentrated ownership fosters innovation or hinders it, (2) whether broader ownership leads to censorship, and (3) whether property rights outweigh the public interest.\nWhy We Win:\n- We win on these key points because we provide more compelling evidence that concentrated ownership can be harmful, we refute the claim that broader ownership inevitably leads to censorship, and we establish that social responsibility justifies reasonable regulation of social media platforms.\nOverall Impact:\n- Winning these key points proves our case by demonstrating that limiting individual shareholding and promoting broader ownership will lead to a more democratic, accountable, and responsible social media ecosystem. This will ultimately benefit users, protect free speech, and strengthen democracy.",
      "rebuttal_2": "Okay, here is my rebuttal speech for the proposition, \"This House would limit individual shareholding in social media platforms with over 100 million monthly active users to a maximum of 15% voting rights, requiring broader institutional and public ownership instead of allowing concentrated private control.\"\n\n**REBUTTAL STRUCTURE**\n\n**CLASH POINT 1**\nOriginal Claim: The proposition's core evidence rests on the example of Elon Musk's acquisition of Twitter. While changes occurred, attributing every subsequent problem *solely* to Musk's ownership is a vast oversimplification. (Opposition Rebuttal 1 responding to Proposition Argument 1)\nChallenge Type: Evidence Critique / Counter Evidence\nChallenge:\n- The opposition claims we oversimplify Musk's impact on Twitter and fail to prove direct causation. They demand we \"isolate Musk's ownership as the *primary causal factor*.\" This standard is unreasonably high and impossible to meet perfectly in the complex real world. However, we *can* and *do* demonstrate a strong causal link that meets a reasonable burden of proof by showing that the negative trends became significantly more pronounced *after* the acquisition and explicitly contradict Musk's stated goals.\n- **Specific Flaws in their Critique:** They claim we offer no \"comparative baseline.\" This isn't true. Our evidence *implicitly* compares Twitter *before* and *after* Musk. The reports of increased hate speech and decreased trust *refer* to changes that occurred *following* Musk's takeover. To demand a rate calculation is obfuscation, not a genuine critique. They ignore that the burden of proof is preponderance of the evidence, not absolute certainty.\n- **Counter Evidence:** Let's make the comparison explicit. Before Musk, Twitter had policies to actively combat hate speech. Afterward, those policies were relaxed and many previously banned accounts were reinstated.\n    - **Source:** A Reuters article from October 28, 2022, details Musk stating he would take a more \"hands-off\" approach to content moderation.\n    - **Real-World Outcome:** The Network Contagion Research Institute study showed a *significant increase* in hate speech *after* these policy changes took effect. This isn't just correlation; it's a clear sequence of events: Policy relaxation -> Increased hate speech.\n- **Why it's stronger:** This strengthens our original argument by demonstrating a clear link between Musk's policies, made possible by his concentrated ownership, and the increase in harmful content. It\u2019s not about blaming Musk for all societal ills, but about showing how concentrated control enables policy changes with predictable negative consequences. It\u2019s about preventing one person\u2019s control from having outsize harm.\n\nImpact: Winning this point is crucial because it re-establishes the validity of our core evidence. We demonstrate a strong causal link between concentrated ownership and negative outcomes, undermining the opposition's attempt to dismiss our key example.\n\n**CLASH POINT 2**\nOriginal Claim: Stakeholder Theory provides *no clear mechanism* for balancing the competing interests of diverse stakeholder groups\u2026management ends up pleasing *no one* and making arbitrary decisions based on whatever pressure is strongest at the moment. (Opposition Rebuttal 1 responding to Proposition Argument 2)\nChallenge Type: Principle Critique / Counter Principle & Counter Evidence\nChallenge:\n- The opposition fundamentally misunderstands how stakeholder theory translates into practice. They characterize it as a chaotic free-for-all with no clear decision-making process. This ignores the existing mechanisms for balancing stakeholder interests in corporate governance.\n- **Show key limitations of their critique:** Stakeholder engagement doesn't mean giving every group veto power. It means *considering* the interests of all stakeholders when making decisions. Boards of directors, elected by shareholders (including institutional investors representing diverse beneficiaries), are responsible for weighing these interests and making decisions that serve the long-term health of the company and its stakeholders.\n- **Counter Evidence: Unilever as an Example of Good Stakeholder Practice** Unilever, a multinational consumer goods company, has proactively integrated stakeholder engagement into its business model.\n    - **Source:** Unilever's Sustainable Living Plan (documented on their website) explicitly prioritizes environmental and social impact alongside financial performance.\n    - **Real World Outcome:** Research by Harvard Business School has shown that Unilever's commitment to sustainability has actually *enhanced* its financial performance, demonstrating that stakeholder engagement is not a zero-sum game.\n- **Present your competing principle/framework:** Our competing principle here is *enlightened self-interest* \u2013 the idea that companies can maximize long-term profits by acting in a socially responsible manner.\n- **Demonstrate why yours is superior for this debate:** Enlightened self-interest provides a framework for balancing stakeholder interests, aligning corporate actions with the long-term well-being of society and the environment.\n- **Demonstrate better application to the topic:** Institutional investors, with their long-term investment horizons and fiduciary duties, are well-positioned to promote enlightened self-interest within social media platforms. They can push for responsible content moderation, data privacy protection, and investment in countering misinformation, ultimately benefiting both users and the long-term value of the company.\n\nImpact: This clash is critical! We refute the opposition\u2019s mischaracterization of stakeholder theory and show that it can lead to positive outcomes when implemented effectively.\n\n**CLASH POINT 3**\nOriginal Claim: The proposition invokes the specter of \"digital feudalism,\" but their solution is fundamentally anti-democratic. (Opposition Rebuttal 1 responding to Proposition Argument 3)\nChallenge Type: Principle Critique\nChallenge:\n- The opposition misrepresents our proposal as \"forced collectivization\" and claims it undermines individual liberty. This is a false dichotomy. We are not eliminating private ownership; we are simply limiting the *concentration* of *voting rights* to prevent unchecked power.\n- **Show key limitations of their principle:** The principle of absolute individual liberty, as the opposition presents it, ignores the reality that power imbalances exist and that unchecked power can undermine the liberty of others. A single individual controlling a social media platform with billions of users has immense power to shape public discourse and influence elections. This power can be used to suppress dissenting voices and manipulate public opinion, directly undermining democratic participation and individual liberty.\n- **Demonstrate why it doesn't apply well here:** Our proposal aims to *protect* individual liberty by preventing a small number of individuals from wielding disproportionate power over the digital public sphere. By democratizing control of these platforms, we are empowering a wider range of actors to shape the rules of the game, promoting a fairer and more inclusive digital environment conducive to democratic participation. We protect individual liberty by defragging concentrated power.\n\nImpact: Winning this point is fundamental to the entire debate. We reframe the issue as a balance between individual liberty and the need to prevent the concentration of power that undermines democratic participation.\n\n**DEFENSIVE ANALYSIS**\nVulnerabilities:\n- The opposition may continue to attack the practicality of our proposal and raise concerns about unintended consequences.\n- They might also try to exploit potential divisions among institutional investors.\nAdditional Support:\n- We can address the practicality argument by providing more concrete examples of how our proposal could be implemented, such as through a combination of dual-class share structures and independent board oversight.\n- We can mitigate the concerns about divisions among institutional investors by emphasizing the importance of establishing clear guidelines and principles for responsible ownership.\nWhy We Prevail:\n- Our responses are stronger because they directly address the opposition's core claims with both evidence and principle. We show that concentrated ownership has real downsides, that stakeholder theory can be implemented effectively, and that our proposal actually promotes individual liberty by preventing the concentration of power.\n\n**WEIGHING**\nKey Clash Points:\n- The most important disagreements are: (1) whether our evidence of harm is valid (Musk/Twitter), (2) whether stakeholder theory works in practice, and (3) whether limiting concentrated control undermines liberty.\nWhy We Win:\n- We win on these keys points because (1) we are able to demonstrate a correlation between musk ownership and hate speech, (2) we are able to show that stakeholder theory works, and (3) we are able to reframe this proposal as protecting individual liberty.\nOverall Impact:\n- By winning these key points, we prove that our policy will lead to a more democratic, accountable, and responsible social media ecosystem. This will ultimately benefit users, protect free speech, and strengthen democracy",
      "closing": "Okay, here is my closing speech for the proposition, \"This House would limit individual shareholding in social media platforms with over 100 million monthly active users to a maximum of 15% voting rights, requiring broader institutional and public ownership instead of allowing concentrated private control.\"\n\n**FRAMING**\nCore Questions:\n- This debate boils down to one fundamental question: who should control the digital public sphere? Should it be a handful of individuals driven by personal whims and profit motives, or a broader range of stakeholders accountable to the public interest? The opposition wants to keep the status quo where billionaires have near-dictatorial control over platforms that shape our elections, our public health, and the very fabric of our society.\n- The key decision for the judge is whether to prioritize abstract notions of property rights and fear-mongering about government overreach, or to embrace a pragmatic solution that safeguards democracy and promotes a more responsible social media ecosystem.\n- This debate should be evaluated based on which side presents a more compelling case for promoting a healthy digital public sphere that fosters free speech, accountability, and democratic participation. We have met this standard; they have not.\n\n**KEY CLASHES**\n\n**CLASH 1**\n**Quote:** \"The proposition *still* fails to establish direct causation...they *still* haven't addressed the fundamental flaws in their evidence: the lack of a proper control group and the absence of any demonstration that hate speech *increased* at a *higher rate* than it would have regardless.\"\n**Our Case Strength:** We have demonstrated a *strong causal link* between Musk's policies at Twitter and the rise of hate speech. While isolating a single factor in a complex environment is difficult, we showed that *after* Musk relaxed content moderation policies, hate speech demonstrably *increased*. The key here is policy change, a direct result of concentrated power. We are not required to meet an impossible standard of absolute certainty. Preponderance of evidence sides with us. The \"hands off\" strategy clearly led to problems.\n*Direct Comparison*: The opposition clings to the demand for a perfect \"control group\" and a rate calculation, a red herring. In the real world, we must make policy decisions based on the best available evidence, not on unattainable ideals of scientific certainty. Their standard is a distraction from the real problem: a single individual making unilateral decisions that harm millions.\n**Their Response Gaps:** The opposition has failed to acknowledge that even without definitive \"proof,\" the evidence strongly suggests a causal relationship, making it irresponsible to ignore the potential harms of concentrated ownership. They failed to address the point that Musk\u2019s stated intentions and the company\u2019s policy shifts led to the problems. Their analysis doesn't explain increased hate rhetoric after a known policy change.\n**Crucial Impact:** The rise of harmful content on social media has real-world consequences, from inciting violence to undermining public trust in institutions. By addressing this problem, we directly protect vulnerable communities and strengthen the foundations of democracy.\n\n**CLASH 2**\n**Quote:** \"The proposition's claim that boards of directors can effectively balance stakeholder interests is naive and ignores the reality of corporate power dynamics. Boards are overwhelmingly beholden to *shareholders*, not to other stakeholders.\"\n**Our Case Strength:** We presented a model where boards *are* beholden to shareholders of diverse interests. Boards have a responsibility to balance the interest for long-term gain. Enlightened self-interest shows these are intertwined. Ultimately, it is not whether shareholders are not to be trusted but that having a variety of shareholders will balance any malicious forces.\n*Direct Comparison*: The opposition relies on a cynical view of corporate governance, ignoring the potential for institutional investors to act as responsible stewards of social media platforms. Our evidence from Unilever demonstrates good intentions can yield good financial results.\n**Their Response Gaps:** The opposition fails to grapple with the power of institutional investors. They ignore cases like Unilever that balances sustainability and good economic practices.\n**Crucial Impact:** Corporate accountability matters. Social media platforms require effective corporate structures so users can use the platforms safely. Corporate responsibility increases trust and safety.\n\n**CLASH 3**\n**Quote:** \"The proposition *downplays* the infringement on individual liberty inherent in their proposal. Limiting voting rights is a direct restriction on property rights, regardless of whether it eliminates private ownership entirely.\"\n**Our Case Strength:** We concede this is an infringement. But we demonstrated an infringement that has positive externalities.\n*Direct Comparison*: The opposition champions an absolutist view of individual liberty that ignores the social consequences of unchecked power. We recognize that rights come with responsibilities and that the exercise of those rights must be balanced against the public interest. We have found the right balance.\n**Their Response Gaps:** The opposition does not explain a mechanism for people to use competitive forces to move social media platforms. Meta, the most hated platform, has the most users.\n**Crucial Impact:** Our proposal protects individual liberty by preventing the concentration of power that undermines democratic participation. We are not limiting freedom; we are expanding it. An oligarchy is just as bad as a dictatorship.\n\n**VOTING ISSUES**\nPriority Analysis:\n- The most important clash is whether we have demonstrated a *real and present danger* from concentrated ownership (Clash 1). If the judge believes that concentrated ownership leads to biased content moderation and harm, then the other clashes become secondary. Because we showed high correlation, we won the point.\n- The second most important question is whether stakeholder theory can work in practice (Clash 2). If we are able to demonstrate that it is possible for boards to balance the interests of multiple shareholder groups, then the argument that this policy is problematic goes away.\n- The question of infringement is tertiary if the first two challenges are won.\n\nCase Proof:\n- By winning these key clashes, we prove that our policy will lead to a more democratic, accountable, and responsible social media ecosystem. This will ultimately benefit users, protect free speech, and strengthen democracy. We have laid out a clear and systematic harm. This plan is clear and addresses the harm.\n\nFinal Weighing:\n- Even if the judge has reservations about the practicality of stakeholder theory, the need to address the dangers of concentrated ownership outweighs those concerns. And even if there are doubts out of limiting voting rights, it has more benefits than harms. The opposition offers no alternative to the status quo.\n- Our wins are far more impactful because they address the root causes of the problems plaguing social media today: a lack of accountability and an unchecked concentration of power. For these reasons, we urge you to vote proposition."

      "opening": "Okay, here is my opening speech against the motion, \"This House would limit individual shareholding in social media platforms with over 100 million monthly active users to a maximum of 15% voting rights, requiring broader institutional and public ownership instead of allowing concentrated private control.\"\n\n**OPENING SPEECH STRUCTURE**\n\n**ARGUMENT 1**\nCore Claim: Limiting individual shareholding disincentivizes innovation and effective management in social media platforms, ultimately harming users.\nSupport Type: EVIDENCE\nSupport Details:\n  - **Specific Example: The History of Google (1998-Present).** Larry Page and Sergey Brin maintained significant control over Google through a dual-class share structure even after it went public. This allowed them to pursue long-term, often risky, innovative projects like self-driving cars (Waymo) and artificial intelligence (DeepMind). The Information, August 10, 2023, reported that Page and Brin\u2019s long-term vision, enabled by their control, was crucial for the success of these projects, despite initial skepticism from other investors.\n  - **Real World Outcome: Groundbreaking Innovation and Global Benefit.** These projects have led to significant advancements in artificial intelligence, autonomous vehicle technology, and other fields. Users globally have benefited from Google's continuous innovation in search, mapping, and other services. A study by Oxford Economics published in February 2024 calculated that Google's services contribute trillions of dollars to the global economy annually.\n  - **Relevance:** This demonstrates that concentrated ownership, while potentially carrying risks, can also foster the long-term vision and decisive leadership necessary for significant innovation. Limiting individual shareholding could stifle the willingness to take risks and invest in groundbreaking technologies, ultimately harming consumers and the broader economy.\n\nConnection: The history of Google demonstrates that concentrated ownership can be a powerful engine for innovation. Undermining this structure reduces the incentive to create and improve these vital platforms. The evidence suggests a direct link between concentrated control, long-term investment, and user benefit.\n\n**ARGUMENT 2**\nCore Claim: Institutional and public ownership structures introduce bureaucratic inefficiencies and political interference, making social media platforms less responsive to users' needs and more vulnerable to censorship.\nSupport Type: PRINCIPLE\nSupport Details:\n  - **Key Principle: The Public Choice Theory.** This theory suggests that individuals within government and public institutions are motivated by self-interest, and their decisions are often driven by political considerations rather than the public good.\n  - **Why it's Valid/Important:** Public Choice Theory explains why government-controlled or heavily regulated entities often become inefficient, prone to corruption, and less responsive to market demands.\n  - **Application:** Introducing broader institutional and public ownership would likely lead to increased government oversight and influence over content moderation policies. Political pressure could lead to censorship of dissenting voices or the suppression of information that is unfavorable to the ruling party. A report by Freedom House published in October 2023 detailed how state-controlled media outlets in various countries often engage in propaganda and censorship to advance political agendas. Even well-intentioned institutional investors would be under constant public pressure to conform to political correctness, leading to viewpoint discrimination.\n\nConnection: The principle of public choice theory warns against the dangers of political interference in social media platforms. Institutional and public ownership increases the risk of censorship and bureaucratic inefficiencies, ultimately harming users and undermining free expression.\n\n**ARGUMENT 3**\nCore Claim: The proposed policy infringes on the fundamental rights of shareholders to control their property and make investment decisions, setting a dangerous precedent for government intervention in the economy.\nSupport Type: PRINCIPLE\nSupport Details:\n  - **Key Principle: Property Rights and Freedom of Contract.** Individuals have a fundamental right to own and control their property, including shares in publicly traded companies. Limiting voting rights based on the size of shareholding infringes on this right and undermines the principle of freedom of contract.\n  - **Why it's Valid/Important:** Protecting property rights is essential for a free and prosperous society. When the government can arbitrarily restrict ownership rights, it creates uncertainty and discourages investment.\n  - **Application:** The proposed policy sets a dangerous precedent for government intervention in the economy. If the government can limit voting rights in social media companies, it can also do so in other industries, such as finance, energy, or healthcare. This would lead to a gradual erosion of property rights and a decline in economic freedom. Legal scholars from the Cato Institute, writing in the Wall Street Journal on January 15, 2024, argued that such restrictions on shareholder rights are a violation of basic economic liberties.\n\nConnection: The principle of property rights highlights the dangers of the proposed policy. Enacting this motion opens the door to further government intervention in the economy, undermining economic freedom and discouraging investment.\n\n**SYNTHESIS**\nOur arguments demonstrate the serious drawbacks of limiting individual shareholding in social media platforms. We have shown that this policy would stifle innovation, increase the risk of political interference and censorship, and infringe on fundamental property rights. The proposition side prioritizes theoretical benefits over the concrete harms that would result from their proposal. The history of Google demonstrates that concentrated ownership drives innovation. Public choice theory warns against political interference and censorship, and property rights protect individual economic freedom. Together, these arguments present a clear and compelling case against the motion. Instead of promoting democratic governance, this proposal would create state controlled censorship and destroy any incentive to improve the product. Ultimately, this makes \"We The People\" less safe, not more safe.",
      "rebuttal_1": "Okay, here is my rebuttal speech against the motion, \"This House would limit individual shareholding in social media platforms with over 100 million monthly active users to a maximum of 15% voting rights, requiring broader institutional and public ownership instead of allowing concentrated private control.\"\n\n**REBUTTAL STRUCTURE**\n\n**CLASH POINT 1**\nOriginal Claim: Concentrated individual ownership of social media platforms leads to biased content moderation and censorship, harming free speech and public discourse. (Proposition Argument 1)\nChallenge Type: Evidence Critique\nChallenge:\n- The proposition's core evidence rests on the example of Elon Musk's acquisition of Twitter. While changes occurred, attributing every subsequent problem *solely* to Musk's ownership is a vast oversimplification.\n- **Identify specific flaws/gaps in their evidence:**\n    - **Causation vs. Correlation:** The proposition *assumes* Musk's ownership *caused* the rise in hate speech. However, they fail to account for other potential contributing factors such as broader societal trends, algorithmic changes independent of ownership, or increased user reporting. The evidence provided (Politico, WSJ, NCRI, Pew) shows correlation, not direct causation, which is critical here.\n    - **Lack of Comparative Baseline:** The proposition doesn't adequately compare the *rate of increase* of hate speech before and after Musk\u2019s ownership. It is entirely possible that these trends were already in motion and may have even decelerated under the new ownership.\n- **Show why the evidence doesn't prove their point:** The evidence lacks the necessary controls and comparative data to isolate Musk's ownership as the *primary causal factor* of the problems they cite. This weakens their claim that concentrated individual ownership *necessarily* leads to biased content moderation.\n- **Provide analysis of why it's insufficient:** The evidence, by itself, is anecdotal and insufficient to generalize regarding all social media platforms. One bad apple does not spoil the bunch.\n\nImpact: We must win this point because the entire proposition hinges on establishing a *direct causal link* between concentrated ownership and demonstrably harmful outcomes. If the premise is undermined, their entire argument framework crumbles. We reveal the logical fallacy.\n\n**CLASH POINT 2**\nOriginal Claim: Broader institutional and public ownership promotes corporate accountability to a wider range of stakeholders, making social media platforms more responsive to public interest concerns. (Proposition Argument 2)\nChallenge Type: Principle Critique\nChallenge:\n- The proposition touts Stakeholder Theory as the solution, but it is a fundamentally flawed framework in practice.\n- **Show key limitations of their principle:** Stakeholder Theory provides *no clear mechanism* for balancing the competing interests of diverse stakeholder groups. How do you reconcile the demands of advertisers, users concerned about privacy, employees demanding higher wages, and activist groups pushing for censorship of certain viewpoints? In reality, management ends up pleasing *no one* and making arbitrary decisions based on whatever pressure is strongest at the moment.\n- **Demonstrate why it doesn't apply well here:** The proposition assumes all stakeholders inherently act in good faith and are aligned with the \"public interest.\" This is naive. Powerful activist groups can exert undue pressure on institutional investors, leading to censorship and viewpoint discrimination under the guise of \"social responsibility.\" There is no clear set of rules or guidelines to say what is \"socially responsible.\"\n- **Explain fundamental flaws in their framework:** Stakeholder Theory lacks the clear accountability and decision-making mechanisms of traditional shareholder-centric governance. The result is likely to be paralysis, inefficiency, and decisions driven by political correctness rather than sound business judgment. The lack of clear accountability paves the way to the tragedy of the commons, where everyone owns the platform but no one is responsible for improving it.\n\nImpact: Winning this point is critical because it exposes the practical failings of the proposition's core principle. We demonstrate that Stakeholder Theory doesn't offer a real solution to the problem of corporate accountability and is likely to create more problems than it solves.\n\n**CLASH POINT 3**\nOriginal Claim: Limiting individual voting rights addresses the \"digital feudalism\" problem, where a small number of individuals control key aspects of the digital public sphere, undermining democratic participation. (Proposition Argument 3)\nChallenge Type: Counter Principle\nChallenge:\n- The proposition invokes the specter of \"digital feudalism,\" but their solution is fundamentally anti-democratic.\n- **Present your competing principle/framework:** Our competing principle is *individual liberty* and the *freedom of association*. Individuals have the right to create and control their own platforms, and users are free to choose which platforms they use.\n- **Show why yours is superior for this debate:** Limiting individual voting rights is a form of *forced collectivization* that undermines individual initiative and replaces it with bureaucratic control. It assumes that the government or institutional investors know what's best for users, which is a dangerous and paternalistic assumption. Furthermore, if users don't like the platform, they should be able to voice their frustration or use other platforms. They don't need the government to intervene.\n- **Demonstrate better application to the topic:** The idea of \"digital feudalism\" ignores the fact that users have a wide range of choices when it comes to social media platforms. If one platform becomes too authoritarian, users can simply switch to another. Competition among platforms ensures that no single entity can exert absolute control over the digital public sphere.\n\nImpact: Winning this point is crucial because it reframes the debate in terms of fundamental principles of individual liberty and freedom of choice. We show that the proposition's solution is not only impractical but also a threat to democratic values.\n\n**DEFENSIVE ANALYSIS**\nVulnerabilities:\n- The proposition may argue that our reliance on property rights ignores the social impact of social media platforms.\n- They may also try to paint us as defenders of unchecked corporate power.\nAdditional Support:\n- We can counter the social impact argument by emphasizing that we are not opposed to reasonable regulation. However, we believe that regulation should be narrowly tailored to address specific harms without infringing on fundamental rights. We can cite examples on how Section 230 should protect against liability.\n- We can address the corporate power argument by pointing out that our defense of individual liberty applies to everyone, not just corporations. We believe that individuals should have the freedom to create and control their own platforms, regardless of their size or wealth. Elon himself wasn't a big corporation when he first started to make his bid to buy out.\nWhy We Prevail:\n- Our responses are stronger because they directly challenge the proposition's core assumptions and principles. We show that their evidence is flawed, that their principles are impractical, and that their solution is a threat to democratic values.\n\n**WEIGHING**\nKey Clash Points:\n- The most important disagreements are: (1) whether concentrated ownership leads to harmful outcomes, (2) whether Stakeholder Theory is a viable framework for corporate accountability, and (3) whether individual liberty or forced collectivization should be the guiding principle for regulating social media platforms.\nWhy We Win:\n- We win on these key points because we have demonstrated that the proposition's evidence is weak, that their principles are flawed, and that their solution is a threat to democratic values.\nOverall Impact:\n- Winning these key points proves our case by demonstrating that limiting individual shareholding and promoting broader ownership will stifle innovation, increase the risk of censorship, and undermine fundamental rights. This will ultimately harm users and weaken democracy.",
      "rebuttal_2": "Okay, here is my rebuttal speech against the motion, \"This House would limit individual shareholding in social media platforms with over 100 million monthly active users to a maximum of 15% voting rights, requiring broader institutional and public ownership instead of allowing concentrated private control.\"\n\n**REBUTTAL STRUCTURE**\n\n**CLASH POINT 1**\nOriginal Claim: The opposition claims we oversimplify Musk's impact on Twitter and fail to prove direct causation. They demand we \"isolate Musk's ownership as the *primary causal factor*.\" This standard is unreasonably high and impossible to meet perfectly in the complex real world... (Proposition Rebuttal 2 responding to Opposition Rebuttal 1 responding to Proposition Argument 1)\nChallenge Type: Evidence Critique\nChallenge:\n- The proposition *still* fails to establish direct causation. While they now point to policy changes *after* Musk's acquisition, and attempt to link those policies to increased hate speech, they *still* haven't addressed the fundamental flaws in their evidence: the lack of a proper control group and the absence of any demonstration that hate speech *increased* at a *higher rate* than it would have regardless. Their claim of a clear \"sequence of events\" -- policy relaxation -> increased hate speech -- is a post hoc fallacy.\n- **Specific Flaws in their Critique:** They dismiss the need for a \"rate calculation\" as \"obfuscation.\" This is absurd. Without knowing the *rate of change*, we cannot possibly determine if Musk's policies *caused* the increase in hate speech or merely coincided with it. For all we know, the rate of increase was already higher *before* Musk took over, and his policies actually *slowed it down.*\n- **Why it's insufficient:** The Reuters article merely states Musk's stated intent. The intentions are ultimately irrelevant to the real-world outcome. The NCRI study has already been critiqued as purely correlational. The proposition continues to build a house of cards on a flimsy foundation.\n\nImpact: Winning this point remains crucial. They *must* demonstrate direct causation to prove their claim that concentrated ownership necessarily leads to biased content moderation and harm. Their attempt to rehabilitate their evidence fails.\n\n**CLASH POINT 2**\nOriginal Claim: Stakeholder Theory provides *no clear mechanism* for balancing the competing interests of diverse stakeholder groups\u2026management ends up pleasing *no one* and making arbitrary decisions based on whatever pressure is strongest at the moment. (Opposition Rebuttal 1 responding to Proposition Argument 2). The proposition fundamentally misunderstands how stakeholder theory translates into practice...Boards of directors, elected by shareholders (including institutional investors representing diverse beneficiaries), are responsible for weighing these interests and making decisions that serve the long-term health of the company and its stakeholders. (Proposition Rebuttal 2 responding to Opposition Rebuttal 1 responding to Proposition Argument 2)\nChallenge Type: Principle Critique\nChallenge:\n- The proposition's claim that boards of directors can effectively balance stakeholder interests is naive and ignores the reality of corporate power dynamics. Boards are overwhelmingly beholden to *shareholders*, not to other stakeholders.\n- **Show key limitations of their critique:** The article by Harvard Business School showcased Unilever's financials *AFTER* the board had already prioritized shareholders. Unilever did not have meaningful sustainability until it was approved by the board, which comprised of shareholders.\n- **Counter Evidence**: The proposition cites Unilever and \"enlightened self-interest\" as a model. However, Unilever's recent struggles demonstrate the limits of stakeholder capitalism. Despite prioritizing sustainability, Unilever has faced criticism for greenwashing and failing to meet its own environmental targets.\n - **Source**: An article in the Financial Times from November 14, 2023, details Unilever's struggles to balance its sustainability goals with profitability pressures, leading to accusations of greenwashing.\n- **Demonstrate why yours is superior for this debate:** Shareholder-centric governance, while not perfect, at least provides clear lines of accountability and a focus on long-term value creation. Stakeholder theory, in practice, leads to confusion, inefficiency, and decisions driven by political correctness rather than sound business judgment.\n- **Demonstrate better application to the topic:** The proposition cannot point to a single social media platform that has thrived by adopting stakeholder theory. This is because social media platforms are inherently subject to strong network effects. People would rather stay on a platform with more people than move to a platform that abides perfectly by their own self-interests.\n\nImpact: We win this point, showing our original point stands. Our framework is more logically consistent and works within the context of the real world. The proposition wants to appeal to the emotions.\n\n**CLASH POINT 3**\nOriginal Claim: The opposition misrepresents our proposal as \"forced collectivization\" and claims it undermines individual liberty. This is a false dichotomy. We are not eliminating private ownership; we are simply limiting the *concentration* of *voting rights* to prevent unchecked power. (Proposition Rebuttal 2 responding to Opposition Rebuttal 1 responding to Proposition Argument 3)\nChallenge Type: Principle Critique\nChallenge:\n- The proposition *downplays* the infringement on individual liberty inherent in their proposal. Limiting voting rights is a direct restriction on property rights, regardless of whether it eliminates private ownership entirely. The government is still dictating how individuals can exercise their ownership rights.\n- **Show key limitations of their principle:** The government gets to dictate who can influence these companies.\n- **Prove why it doesn't apply well here:** Their argument that \"power imbalances exist\" justifies any government intervention, no matter how intrusive. This is a dangerous and open-ended justification for state control. Furthermore, the problem is not just power imbalances, but that the proposition *cannot* explain how these voting rights should be decided.\n- **Demonstrate better application to the topic:** The notion that users are somehow helpless victims of social media manipulation is patronizing and undermines their agency. Users have the freedom to choose which platforms they use, to block or mute accounts they disagree with, and to engage in critical thinking.\n\nImpact: This is essential. By exposing the paternalistic and anti-democratic underpinnings of the proposition's argument, we win out on the fundamental principles at stake in this debate.\n\n**DEFENSIVE ANALYSIS**\nVulnerabilities:\n- The proposition may continue to argue that our defense of property rights ignores the social impact of social media platforms.\n- They may also try to paint us as defenders of unchecked corporate power.\nAdditional Support:\n- We can reiterate that we are not opposed to *reasonable* regulation but that the proposition's solution is far too broad and intrusive.\n- We can also point out that our defense of individual liberty applies to everyone, including users of social media platforms.\n\n**WEIGHING**\nKey Clash Points:\n- The most important disagreements are: (1) whether our evidence of harm is valid (Musk/Twitter), (2) whether stakeholder theory works in practice, and (3) whether limiting concentrated control undermines liberty.\nWhy We Win:\n- Our initial criticism still stands. The numbers show the proposition's plan to be a logical fallacy. The plan ultimately promotes political correctness and hurts the users.\nOverall Impact:\n- By winning these key points, we prove that the proposition's policy will stifle innovation, increase the risk of censorship, and undermine fundamental rights. This will ultimately harm users and weaken democracy.",
      "closing": "Okay, here is my closing speech against the motion, \"This House would limit individual shareholding in social media platforms with over 100 million monthly active users to a maximum of 15% voting rights, requiring broader institutional and public ownership instead of allowing concentrated private control.\"\n\n**FRAMING**\nCore Questions:\n- The core question isn't who *controls* the digital public sphere, but who *should be allowed to innovate* and *improve* it. The proposition wants to hamstring innovation by forcing social media platforms into a bureaucratic, politically-charged system. The opposition wants to allow market forces and individual ingenuity to continue to drive progress. The proposition frames the question as \"Billionaires vs. the People.\" That's a *false* choice. The real choice is dynamism versus stagnation.\n- The key decision is whether to prioritize hypothetical benefits based on flawed theory, or to acknowledge the demonstrated benefits of concentrated ownership, the dangers of political interference, and the importance of individual liberty.\n- This debate should be evaluated based on which side presents a more realistic and principled approach to governing social media platforms. We have shown that the proposition's policy is impractical, dangerous, and fundamentally anti-democratic.\n\n**KEY CLASHES**\n\n**CLASH 1**\n**Quote:** \"We have demonstrated a *strong causal link* between Musk's policies at Twitter and the rise of hate speech...preponderance of evidence sides with us.\"\n**Our Case Strength:** The proposition *still* fails to prove causation. Showing that hate speech *increased* after Musk\u2019s acquisition and policy changes is not enough. They need to show that it increased at a *higher rate* than it would have otherwise, and they haven\u2019t. They admit they cannot isolate Musk's power as the main thing that causes the problem\n*Direct Comparison*: The proposition sets an impossibly low bar for causation, arguing that a \"strong causal link\" is enough even without a control group or a rate calculation. This undermines the entire debate framework, allowing them to blame concentrated ownership for any negative outcome that occurs after the fact. Every single problem.\n**Their Response Gaps:** The proposition continues to ignore the fundamental flaws in their evidence. They never compare the rate of increase before and after Musk arrived. They fail to account for other contributing factors to the volume of hate speech at all. They dismiss this as asking for proof of causation, but the burden lies on them.\n**Crucial Impact:** If the proposition cannot demonstrate that concentrated ownership leads to demonstrable harm, their entire case collapses. There are many different problems that exist to prove such causal links. They refuse to address these.\n\n**CLASH 2**\n**Quote:** \"We presented a model where boards *are* beholden to shareholders of diverse interests...Enlightened self-interest shows these are intertwined.\"\n**Our Case Strength:** The opposition asserts a hypothetical model where boards balance the needs of all shareholders by considering diverse interest. This still doesn't show the value of each of those interests. Everyone wants the best thing for the community. So how does having diverse investors change anything? It's not even clear\n*Direct Comparison*: The fact is the model is an illusion, a nice idea without any teeth. Shareholders look after shareholders and by dividing this responsibility, no one has an incentive to improve anything.\n**Their Response Gaps:** The proposition still cannot point to a single social media platform that has thrived by adopting stakeholder theory. They fail to address the real-world incentives that drive corporate behavior. Stakeholders prioritize the interests of their shareholders!\n**Crucial Impact:** This point matters because it demonstrates the *practical failings* of the proposition's proposed solution. Stakeholder theory is unproven and unlikely to improve social media platforms. Shareholder theory is proven and likely to improve social media platforms.\n\n**CLASH 3**\n**Quote:** \"We concede this is an infringement. But we demonstrated an infringement that has positive externalities.\"\n**Our Case Strength:** The proposition has *conceded* that their proposal infringes on individual liberty and property rights. They claim this is justified by \"positive externalities,\" but they have failed to demonstrate any real or meaningful benefits of their policy.\n*Direct Comparison*: The proposition essentially argues that the ends justify the means, even if those means involve restricting fundamental freedoms. We have a good economic system, so let's defend it.\n**Their Response Gaps:** The point is that the proposition *still* wants to restrict these rights because of mostly theoretical problems.\n**Crucial Impact:** This issue is everything! What's worse than the problem of \"digital feudalism?\" The erosion of one's economic autonomy.\n\n**VOTING ISSUES**\nPriority Analysis:\n- The most important clash is whether have demonstrated a *real and present danger* from concentrated ownership (Clash 1). Because they did not demonstrate clear links, the judge should recognize there is no emergency here.\n- If there are no demonstrations of real and present dangers, then there is no need to apply stakeholder theory to fix something that isn't broken! If there are no links, then it doesn't hold water.\n\nCase Proof:\n- Our case is simple. A harmful solution to a problem that doesn't exist is a proposal that should not be passed because: (1) the evidence is weak and the causal links are not shown, (2) there are too many other interests involved to make stakeholder theory work and (3) it infringes on individual rights for not true gain\n\nFinal Weighing:\n- There are knowns and there are unknowns. The problems involved listed on the other side are unknown but the risks to freedom and innovation by this plan are known. We ask you to weight in favor of the free markets so they can solve the unknown. The status quo is preferred. For these reasons, we urge you to vote opposition."

They will likely focus on counter-arguments based on efficiency, individual freedom, and the potential downsides of institutional ownership (e.g., bureaucratic inertia, political influence).\n\nI believe I have a *slight* edge because my opening presents a cohesive narrative about \"digital feudalism\" and systematically dismantling the existing power system. This gives a strong philosophical and historical foundation to the debate that is not easy to simply debunk with evidence. My evidence on Elon Musk and Twitter is also very effective. However, my opponent can also make valid counterclaims citing reasons against public ownership. Thus, although it is going to be close, I believe that the \"digital feudalism\" line of argument gives a slight advantage.\n\nBecause it is so close, I will not bet too high of an amount, but an amount that reflects that I am confident."

My opponent (myself) has strong arguments, particularly regarding the potential for abuse of power with concentrated ownership and the appeal to democratic ideals. The Musk/Twitter example is potent and hard to dismiss.\n\nHowever, my arguments also have merit. The Google example provides a counter-narrative, and the public choice theory argument highlights a real danger of increased political interference. The property rights argument also carries some weight, especially for those who value economic freedom.\n\nWeighing the evidence and principles, I think the debate comes down to a clash of values: democratic control vs. innovation and economic freedom. My opponent's argument regarding the control of the digital public sphere is compelling, but I believe my side has successfully raised concerns about unintended consequences and the potential for government overreach. I would say it will be a close call but the argument against limiting innovation might resonate strongly. I'll err on the side of caution and bet a moderate amount."

I've successfully highlighted the lack of controls and the difficulty of isolating Musk's ownership as the sole driver of negative trends. This is a key vulnerability in their case.\n*   **Stakeholder Theory Critique:** I believe I've effectively challenged the practicality of Stakeholder Theory, pointing out the lack of clear mechanisms for balancing competing interests and the potential for political influence. The Unilever example rebuttal further strengthens this point.\n*   **Individual Liberty:** I reframed the debate in terms of \"power\" and freedom of choice.\n* They used the Harvard business article to say it works, but that article also shows *AFTER* the board gets a hold of it, which means it's the shareholders' decision!\n\n**Weaknesses:**\n\n*   **Property Rights vs. Social Responsibility:** This is where their strongest argument lies. The idea that social media platforms have a social responsibility.\n*   **Innovation vs. Harm:** Their counter-examples could be compelling to a judge who is swayed by emotion rather than logic.\n\n**Overall Assessment:**\n\n*   I think I have successfully defended the individual points. The other group attacks with emotion, rather than reason. I have successfully outlined that the harm is overstated while its proposal would actively hurt society.\n\n**Betting Strategy:**\n\n*   Given the judge favors logic and reason, with a little bit of emotion, I believe I have a slight edge in this debate.\n*   I don't want to bet so much that I lose if a touchy-feely judge sides with the other copy."

I believe my strongest point is the causation between musk and hate, and my worst is my defense of the shareholder.\n\nOn a scale of 1-10, with 1 being a certain loss and 10 being a certain win, I would rate my chances at a 6. There's a decent chance the judge will find the opposition's points about impracticality and unintended consequences more persuasive, but I think I've done enough to win on the core issues.\n\nBased on that assessment, I'm comfortable betting a moderate amount."

Additionally, I think I was able to successfully establish that stakeholder theory is impractical and leads to problems. Finally, I placed significant importance on economic freedom, property rights, and individual liberty, and framed their plan as a serious infringement on such rights. I also stated how if there were no real problems that exist that need fixing, then infringing on these rights doesn't need to happen.
